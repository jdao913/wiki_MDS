In mathematics, an ancient solution to a differential equation is a solution that can be extrapolated backwards to all past times, without singularities. That is, it is a solution "that is defined on a time interval of the form (−∞, T)."[1]
The term was introduced in Grigori Perelman's research on the Ricci flow,[1] and has since been applied to other geometric flows[2][3][4][5] as well as to other systems such as the Navier–Stokes equations[6][7] and heat equation.[8]
