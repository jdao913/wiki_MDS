In mathematics, the Bendixson–Dulac theorem on dynamical systems states that if there exists a 




C

{\displaystyle C^{1}}

 function 



φ
(
x
,
y
)


{\displaystyle \varphi (x,y)}

 (called the Dulac function) such that the expression

∂
(

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial (\varphi f)}{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial (\varphi g)}{\partial y}}}



has the same sign (

0


{\displaystyle \neq 0}

) almost everywhere in a simply connected region of the plane, then the plane autonomous system

{\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dt}}=f(x,y),}











d

{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dt}}=g(x,y)}



has no nonconstant periodic solutions lying entirely within the region.[1] "Almost everywhere" means everywhere except possibly in a set of measure 0, such as a point or line.
The theorem was first established by Swedish mathematician Ivar Bendixson in 1901 and further refined by French mathematician Henri Dulac in 1933 using Green's theorem.
Proof[edit]
Without loss of generality, let there exist a function 



φ
(
x
,
y
)


{\displaystyle \varphi (x,y)}

 such that








∂
(
φ
f
)


∂

∂

)


∂

>
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial (\varphi f)}{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial (\varphi g)}{\partial y}}>0}



in simply connected region 



R


{\displaystyle R}

. Let 



C


{\displaystyle C}

 be a closed trajectory of the plane autonomous system in 



R


{\displaystyle R}

. Let 



D


{\displaystyle D}

 be the interior of 



C


{\displaystyle C}

. Then by Green's Theorem,






∬

{\displaystyle \iint _{D}^{}{\left({\frac {\partial (\varphi f)}{\partial x}}+{\frac {\partial (\varphi g)}{\partial y}}\right)dxdy}=\oint _{C}^{}{\left(-\varphi gdx+\varphi fdy\right)}}








=

.


{\displaystyle =\oint _{C}^{}{\varphi \left(-{\dot {y}}dx+{\dot {x}}dy\right)}.}



But on

d

d

{\displaystyle dx={\dot {x}}dt}

 and 



d

d

{\displaystyle dy={\dot {y}}dt}

, so the integral evaluates to 0. This is a contradiction, so there can be no such closed trajectory
