In fluid dynamics, the Buckley–Leverett equation is a conservation equation used to model two-phase flow in porous media.[1] The Buckley–Leverett equation or the Buckley–Leverett displacement describes an immiscible displacement process, such as the displacement of oil by water, in a one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional reservoir. This equation can be derived from the mass conservation equations of two-phase flow, under the assumptions listed below.

Assumptions[edit]
The Buckley–Leverett equation is derived based on the following assumptions:

Flow is linear and horizontal
Both wetting and non-wetting phases are incompressible
Immiscible phases
Negligible capillary pressure effects (this implies that the pressures of the two phases are equal)
Negligible gravitational forces

General solution[edit]
The characteristic velocity of the Buckley–Leverett equation is given by:

.


{\displaystyle U(S_{w})={\frac {Q}{\phi A}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} f_{w}}{\mathrm {d} S_{w}}}.}



The hyperbolic nature of the equation implies that the solution of the Buckley–Leverett equation has the form 




S

(

{\displaystyle S_{w}(x,t)=S_{w}(x-Ut)}

, where 



U


{\displaystyle U}

 is the characteristic velocity given above. The non-convexity of the fractional flow function

{\displaystyle f_{w}(S_{w})}

 also gives rise to the well known Buckley-Leverett profile, which consists of a shock wave immediately followed by a rarefaction wave.
