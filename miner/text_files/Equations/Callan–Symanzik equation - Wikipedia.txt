In physics, the Callan–Symanzik equation is a differential equation describing the evolution of the n-point correlation functions under variation of the energy scale at which the theory is defined and involves the beta-function of the theory and the anomalous dimensions. This equation has the following structure

It was discovered independently by Curtis Callan[1] and Kurt Symanzik[2][3] in 1970. Later it was used to understand asymptotic freedom.
This equation arises in the framework of renormalization group. It is possible to treat the equation using perturbation theory.
