In differential equations, the mth-degree caloric polynomial (or heat polynomial) is a "parabolically m-homogeneous" polynomial Pm(x, t) that satisfies the heat equation

"Parabolically m-homogeneous" means

{\displaystyle P(\lambda x,\lambda ^{2}t)=\lambda ^{m}P(x,t){\text{ for }}\lambda >0.\,}

{\displaystyle P_{m}(x,t)=\sum _{\ell =0}^{\lfloor m/2\rfloor }{\frac {m!}{\ell !(m-2\ell )!}}x^{m-2\ell }t^{\ell }.}



It is unique up to a factor.
With t = −1, this polynomial reduces to the mth-degree Hermite polynomial in x.
