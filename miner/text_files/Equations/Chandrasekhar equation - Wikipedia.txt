Numerical solution of Chandrasekhar equation


In astrophysics, the Chandrasekhar equation is a dimensionless form of the Poisson equation for the density distribution of a spherically symmetric isothermal gas sphere subjected to its own gravitaional force, named after the Indian American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.[1][2] The equation[3] reads

where

 is the dimensionless radius and 



ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }

 is the related to the density of the gas sphere as

{\displaystyle \rho =\rho _{c}e^{-\psi }}

, where 




ρ

c




{\displaystyle \rho _{c}}

 is the density of the gas at the centre. The equation has no known explicit solution. If a polytropic fluid is used instead of an isotropic fluid, one obtains the Lane–Emden equation. The isothermal assumption is usually modeled to describe the core of a star. The equation is solved with the initial conditions,

{\displaystyle \psi =0,\quad {\frac {d\psi }{d\xi }}=0\quad {\text{at}}\quad \xi =0.}



The equation appears in other branches of physics as well, for example the same equation appears in the Frank-Kamenetskii explosion theory for a spherical vessel.

Derivation[edit]
For an isothermal gaseous star, the pressure 



p


{\displaystyle p}

 is due to the kinetic pressure and radiation pressure

{\displaystyle p={\frac {k_{B}}{WH}}T+{\frac {1}{3}}\sigma T^{4}}



where






k

{\displaystyle k_{B}}

 is the Boltzmann constant




W


{\displaystyle W}

 is the mean molecular weight




H


{\displaystyle H}

 is the mass of the proton




T


{\displaystyle T}

 is the temperature of the star




σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

 is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant

The equation for equilibrium of the star requires a balance between the pressure force and gravitational force

Limitations of the model[edit]
Assuming isothermal sphere has some disadvantages. Though the density obtained as solution of this isothermal gas sphere decreases from the centre, it decreases too slowly to give a well-defined surface and finite mass for the sphere[4]. It can shown that, as 



ξ
≫

{\displaystyle \xi \gg 1}

,

{\displaystyle {\frac {\rho }{\rho _{c}}}=e^{-\psi }={\frac {2}{\xi ^{2}}}\left[1+{\frac {A}{\xi ^{1/2}}}\cos \left({\frac {\sqrt {7}}{2}}\ln \xi +\delta \right)+O(\xi ^{-1})\right]}



where 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 and 



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }

 are constants which will be obtained with numerical solution. This behavior of density gives rise to increase in mass with increase in radii. Thus, the model is usually is valid to describe the core of the star, where the temperature is approximately constant.
Singular solution[edit]
Introducing the transformation

{\displaystyle x=1/\xi }

 transforms the equation to

{\displaystyle x^{4}{\frac {d^{2}\psi }{dx^{2}}}=e^{-\psi }}

{\displaystyle e^{-\psi _{s}}=2x^{2},\quad {\text{or}}\quad -\psi _{s}=2\ln x+\ln 2}



Therefore, a new variable can introduced as 



−
ψ

ln
⁡
x

z


{\displaystyle -\psi =2\ln x+z}

, where the equation for 



z

where


t

⁡
x


{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}z}{dt^{2}}}-{\frac {dz}{dt}}+e^{z}-2=0,\quad {\text{where}}\quad t=\ln x}



This equation can be reduced to first order by introducing





y

{\displaystyle y={\frac {dz}{dt}}=\xi {\frac {d\psi }{d\xi }}-2}

{\displaystyle y{\frac {dy}{dz}}-y+e^{z}-2=0}

There is another reduction directly from the original equation. Let us define

{\displaystyle u={\frac {\xi e^{-\psi }}{d\psi /d\xi }},\quad v=\xi {\frac {d\psi }{d\xi }}}

{\displaystyle {\frac {u}{v}}{\frac {dv}{du}}={\frac {u-1}{u+v-3}}}



Properties[edit]

If 



ψ

ξ

{\displaystyle \psi (\xi )}

 is a solution to Chandrasekhar equation, then 



ψ

)

ln
⁡
A


{\displaystyle \psi (A\xi )-2\ln A}

 is also a solution of the equation, where 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is an arbitrary constant.
The solutions of the Chandrasekhar equation which are finite at the origin have necessarily 



d
ψ

/

d
ξ
=
0


{\displaystyle d\psi /d\xi =0}

 at 



ξ
