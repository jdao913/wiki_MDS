In astrophysics, Chandrasekhar's white dwarf equation is an initial value ordinary differential equation introduced by the Indian American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar,[1] in his study of gravitational potential of a completely degenerate white dwarf stars. The equation reads as[2]

{\displaystyle \varphi (0)=1,\quad \varphi '(0)=0}



where 



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }

 measures the density of white dwarf, 



η


{\displaystyle \eta }

 is the non-dimensional radial distance from the center and 



C


{\displaystyle C}

 is a constant which is related to the density of the white dwarf at the center. When 



C
=
0


{\displaystyle C=0}

, this equation reduces to Lane–Emden equation with polytropic index 



3


{\displaystyle 3}

. In the Lane-Emden equation, the density at the centre can be scaled out of the equation, but for white-dwarfs, the equation is directly tied to the equation.
