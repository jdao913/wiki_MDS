In mathematics, D'Alembert's equation is a first order nonlinear ordinary differential equation, named after the French mathematician Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The equation reads as[1]





y
=
x
f
(
p
)
+
g
(
p
)


{\displaystyle y=xf(p)+g(p)}



where 



p
=
d
y

/

d
x


{\displaystyle p=dy/dx}

. After differentiating once, and rearranging we have








d

g

(

f
(
p
)
−
p



=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {dx}{dp}}+{\frac {xf'(p)+g'(p)}{f(p)-p}}=0}



The above equation is linear.
