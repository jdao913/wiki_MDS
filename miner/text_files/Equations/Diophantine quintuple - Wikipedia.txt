.[1] A set of m positive rational numbers with the similar property that the product of any two is one less than a rational square is known as a rational diophantine m-tuple.

Diophantine m-tuples[edit]
The first diophantine quadruple was found by Fermat: 



{
1
,
3
,
8
,
120
}


{\displaystyle \{1,3,8,120\}}

.[1] It was proved in 1969 by Baker and Davenport [1] that a fifth positive integer cannot be added to this set. However, Euler was able to extend this set by adding the rational number 





777480
8288641




{\displaystyle {\frac {777480}{8288641}}}

.[1]
The question of existence of (integer) diophantine quintuples was one of the oldest outstanding unsolved problems in Number Theory. In 2004 Andrej Dujella showed that at most a finite number of diophantine quintuples exist.[1] In 2016 a resolution was proposed by He, Togbé and Ziegler, subject to peer-review.[2]
The Rational Case[edit]
Diophantus himself found the rational diophantine quadruple 




{


1
16


,


33
16


,


17
4


,


105
16


}



{\displaystyle \left\{{\frac {1}{16}},{\frac {33}{16}},{\frac {17}{4}},{\frac {105}{16}}\right\}}

.[1] More recently, Philip Gibbs found sets of six positive rationals with the property.[3] It is not known whether any larger rational diophantine m-tuples exist or even if there is an upper bound, but it is known that no infinite set of rationals with the property exists.[4]
