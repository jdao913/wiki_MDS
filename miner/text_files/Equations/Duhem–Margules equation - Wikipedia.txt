The Duhem–Margules equation, named for Pierre Duhem and Max Margules, is a thermodynamic statement of the relationship between the two components of a single liquid where the vapour mixture is regarded as an ideal gas:

{\displaystyle \left({\frac {d\,\ln \,P_{A}}{d\,\ln \,x_{A}}}\right)_{T,P}=\left({\frac {d\,\ln \,P_{B}}{d\,\ln \,x_{B}}}\right)_{T,P}}



where PA and PB are the partial vapour pressures of the two constituents and xA and xB are the mole fractions of the liquid.
