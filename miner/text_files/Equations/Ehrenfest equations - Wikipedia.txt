Ehrenfest equations (named after Paul Ehrenfest) are equations which describe changes in specific heat capacity and derivatives of specific volume in second-order phase transitions. The Clausius–Clapeyron relation does not make sense for second-order phase transitions,[1] as both specific entropy and specific volume do not change in second-order phase transitions.

Quantitative consideration[edit]
Ehrenfest equations are the consequence of continuity of specific entropy 



s


{\displaystyle s}

 and specific volume 



v


{\displaystyle v}

, which are first derivatives of specific Gibbs free energy – in second-order phase transitions. If one considers specific entropy 



s


{\displaystyle s}

 as a function of temperature and pressure, then its differential is: 



d
s
=


(



∂
s


∂
T



)


P


d
T
+


(



∂
s


∂
P



)


T


d
P


{\displaystyle ds=\left({{\partial s} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{P}dT+\left({{\partial s} \over {\partial P}}\right)_{T}dP}

. As 





(

P

T

(

)


T


=

(



∂
v


∂

)


P




{\displaystyle \left({{\partial s} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{P}={{c_{P}} \over T},\left({{\partial s} \over {\partial P}}\right)_{T}=-\left({{\partial v} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{P}}

, then the differential of specific entropy also is:




d

P


d
P


{\displaystyle d{s_{i}}={{c_{iP}} \over T}dT-\left({{\partial v_{i}} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{P}dP}

,
where 



i
=
1


{\displaystyle i=1}

 and 



i
=
2


{\displaystyle i=2}

 are the two phases which transit one into other. Due to continuity of specific entropy, the following holds in second-order phase transitions: 




d

s

1



=

d

s

2





{\displaystyle {ds_{1}}={ds_{2}}}

. So,

{\displaystyle \left({c_{2P}-c_{1P}}\right){{dT} \over T}=\left[{\left({{\partial v_{2}} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{P}-\left({{\partial v_{1}} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{P}}\right]dP}


Therefore, the first Ehrenfest equation is:





Δ

P

)

⋅



d
P


d
T






{\displaystyle {\Delta c_{P}=T\cdot \Delta \left({\left({{\partial v} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{P}}\right)\cdot {{dP} \over {dT}}}}

.
The second Ehrenfest equation is got in a like manner, but specific entropy is considered as a function of temperature and specific volume:





Δ

c

V


=
−
T
⋅
Δ

(



(



∂

)


v



)

⋅



d
v


d
T






{\displaystyle {\Delta c_{V}=-T\cdot \Delta \left({\left({{\partial P} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{v}}\right)\cdot {{dv} \over {dT}}}}


The third Ehrenfest equation is got in a like manner, but specific entropy is considered as a function of 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 and 



P


{\displaystyle P}

:





Δ


(



∂
v


∂

)


P

(



(

)


v



)

⋅



d
v


d
P






{\displaystyle {\Delta \left({{\partial v} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{P}=\Delta \left({\left({{\partial P} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{v}}\right)\cdot {{dv} \over {dP}}}}

.
Continuity of specific volume as a function of 



T


{\displaystyle T}

 and 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 gives the fourth Ehrenfest equation:





Δ


(



∂
v


∂
T



)


P


=

Δ

(



(



∂
v


∂

)


T



)

⋅



d
P


d
T






{\displaystyle {\Delta \left({{\partial v} \over {\partial T}}\right)_{P}=-\Delta \left({\left({{\partial v} \over {\partial P}}\right)_{T}}\right)\cdot {{dP} \over {dT}}}}

.
Application[edit]
Derivatives of Gibbs free energy are not always finite. Transitions between different magnetic states of metals can't be described by Ehrenfest equations.
