Triangles with an angle of 60°[edit]




An Eisenstein triple


Triangles with an angle of 60° are a special case of the Law of Cosines:[1][2][3]

{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}-ab+b^{2}.}



When the lengths of the sides are integers, the values form a set known as an Eisenstein triple.[4]
Examples of Eisenstein triples include:[5]
