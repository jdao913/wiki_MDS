Graph of xy = yx.


In general, exponentiation fails to be commutative. However, the equation 




x

y


=

y

x




{\displaystyle x^{y}=y^{x}}

 holds in special cases, such as 



x
=
2
,
y
=
4.


{\displaystyle x=2,y=4.}

History[edit]
The equation 




x

y


=

y

x




{\displaystyle x^{y}=y^{x}}

 is mentioned in a letter of Bernoulli to Goldbach (29 June 1728[2]). The letter contains a statement that when 



x
≠
y
,


{\displaystyle x\neq y,}

 the only solutions in natural numbers are 



(
2
,
4
)


{\displaystyle (2,4)}

 and 



(
4
,
2
)
,


{\displaystyle (4,2),}

 although there are infinitely many solutions in rational numbers.[3][4] The reply by Goldbach (31 January 1729[2]) contains general solution of the equation obtained by substituting 



y
=
v
x
.


{\displaystyle y=vx.}

[3] A similar solution was found by Euler.[4]
J. van Hengel pointed out that if 



r
,
n


{\displaystyle r,n}

 are positive integers, 



r
≥
3


{\displaystyle r\geq 3}

 or 



n
≥
3


{\displaystyle n\geq 3}

 then 




r

r
+
n


>
(
r
+
n

)

r


;


{\displaystyle r^{r+n}>(r+n)^{r};}

 therefore it is enough to consider possibilities 



x
=
1


{\displaystyle x=1}

 and 



x
=
2


{\displaystyle x=2}

 in order to find solutions in natural numbers.[4][5]
The problem was discussed in a number of publications.[2][3][4] In 1960, the equation was among questions on William Lowell Putnam Competition[6][7] which prompted A. Hausner to extend results to algebraic number fields.[3][8]
Positive real solutions[edit]

Main source:[1]

An infinite set of trivial solutions in positive real numbers is given by 



x
=
y
.


{\displaystyle x=y.}


Nontrivial solutions can be found by assuming 



x
≠
y


{\displaystyle x\neq y}

 and letting 



y
=
v
x
.


{\displaystyle y=vx.}

 Then





(
v
x

)

x


=

x

v
x


=
(

x

v



)

x


.


{\displaystyle (vx)^{x}=x^{vx}=(x^{v})^{x}.}



Raising both sides to the power 






1
x





{\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{x}}}

 and dividing by 



x
,


{\displaystyle x,}







v
=

x

v
−
1


.


{\displaystyle v=x^{v-1}.}



Then nontrivial solutions in positive real numbers are expressed as





x
=

v


1

v
−
1




,


{\displaystyle x=v^{\frac {1}{v-1}},}






y
=

v


v

v
−
1




.


{\displaystyle y=v^{\frac {v}{v-1}}.}



Setting 



v
=
2


{\displaystyle v=2}

 or 



v
=



1
2





{\displaystyle v={\tfrac {1}{2}}}

 generates the nontrivial solution in positive integers, 




4

2


=

2

4


.


{\displaystyle 4^{2}=2^{4}.}


The trivial and non-trivial solutions intersect when 



v
=
1


{\displaystyle v=1}

. The equations above cannot be evaluated directly, but we can take the limit as 



v
→
1


{\displaystyle v\to 1}

. This is most conveniently done by substituting 



v
=
1
+
1

/

n


{\displaystyle v=1+1/n}

 and letting 



n
→
∞


{\displaystyle n\to \infty }

, so





x
=

lim

v
→
1



v


1

v
−
1




=

lim

n
→
∞


(
1
+


1
n



)

n


=
e
.


{\displaystyle x=\lim _{v\to 1}v^{\frac {1}{v-1}}=\lim _{n\to \infty }(1+{\frac {1}{n}})^{n}=e.}



Thus, the line and curve intersect at x = y = e.
