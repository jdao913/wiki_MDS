In mathematics, specifically in the theory of Markovian stochastic processes in probability theory, the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation is an identity relating the joint probability distributions of different sets of coordinates on a stochastic process. The equation was derived independently by both the British mathematician Sydney Chapman and the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov.

Suppose that { fi } is an indexed collection of random variables, that is, a stochastic process. Let

be the joint probability density function of the values of the random variables f1 to fn. Then, the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation is

i.e. a straightforward marginalization over the nuisance variable.
(Note that we have not yet assumed anything about the temporal (or any other) ordering of the random variables — the above equation applies equally to the marginalization of any of them.)
Application to time-dilated Markov chains[edit]
When the stochastic process under consideration is Markovian, the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation is equivalent to an identity on transition densities. In the Markov chain setting, one assumes that i1 < ... < in. Then, because of the Markov property,

{\displaystyle p_{i_{1},\ldots ,i_{n}}(f_{1},\ldots ,f_{n})=p_{i_{1}}(f_{1})p_{i_{2};i_{1}}(f_{2}\mid f_{1})\cdots p_{i_{n};i_{n-1}}(f_{n}\mid f_{n-1}),}



where the conditional probability 




p

)


{\displaystyle p_{i;j}(f_{i}\mid f_{j})}

 is the transition probability between the times

{\displaystyle i>j}

. So, the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation takes the form

{\displaystyle p_{i_{3};i_{1}}(f_{3}\mid f_{1})=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }p_{i_{3};i_{2}}(f_{3}\mid f_{2})p_{i_{2};i_{1}}(f_{2}\mid f_{1})\,df_{2}.}



Informally, this says that the probability of going from state 1 to state 3 can be found from the probabilities of going from 1 to an intermediate state 2 and then from 2 to 3, by adding up over all the possible intermediate states 2.
When the probability distribution on the state space of a Markov chain is discrete and the Markov chain is homogeneous, the Chapman–Kolmogorov equations can be expressed in terms of (possibly infinite-dimensional) matrix multiplication, thus:





P
(
t
+
s
)
=
P
(
t
)
P
(
s
)



{\displaystyle P(t+s)=P(t)P(s)\,}



where P(t) is the transition matrix of jump t, i.e., P(t) is the matrix such that entry (i,j) contains the probability of the chain moving from state i to state j in t steps.
As a corollary, it follows that to calculate the transition matrix of jump t, it is sufficient to raise the transition matrix of jump one to the power of t, that is





P
(
t
)
=

P

t


.



{\displaystyle P(t)=P^{t}.\,}



The differential form of the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation is known as master equation.
