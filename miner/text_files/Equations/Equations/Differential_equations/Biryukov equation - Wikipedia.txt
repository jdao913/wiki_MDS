Sine oscillations F = 0.01


The Biryukov equation (or Biryukov oscillator), named after Vadim Biryukov (1946), is a non-linear second-order differential equation used to model damped oscillators.[1]
The equation is given by

Eq. (1) is a special case of the Lienard equation; it describes the auto-oscillations.
Solution (1) at a separate time intervals when f(y) is constant is given by[2]
