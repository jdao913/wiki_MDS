This article is about a mathematical concept. For other uses, see Forcing function.
In a system of differential equations used to describe a time-dependent process, a forcing function is a function that appears in the equations and is only a function of time, and not of any of the other variables.[1][2] In effect, it is a constant for each value of t.
In the more general case, any nonhomogeneous source function in any variable can be described as a forcing function, and the resulting solution can often be determined using a superposition of linear combinations of the homogeneous solutions and the forcing term.[3]
