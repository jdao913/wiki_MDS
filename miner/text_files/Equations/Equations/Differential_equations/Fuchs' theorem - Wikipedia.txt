In mathematics, Fuchs' theorem, named after Lazarus Fuchs, states that a second order differential equation of the form

p
(
x

y

q
(
x
)
y
=
g
(
x
)


{\displaystyle y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=g(x)}



has a solution expressible by a generalised Frobenius series when 



p
(
x
)


{\displaystyle p(x)}

, 



q
(
x
)


{\displaystyle q(x)}

 and 



g
(
x
)


{\displaystyle g(x)}

 are analytic at 



x
=
a


{\displaystyle x=a}

 or 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 is a regular singular point. That is, any solution to this second order differential equation can be written as

{\displaystyle y=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }a_{n}(x-a)^{n+s},\quad a_{0}\neq 0}
