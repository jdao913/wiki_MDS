In mathematical heat conduction, the Green's function number is used to uniquely categorize certain fundamental solutions of the heat equation to make existing solutions easier to identify, store, and retrieve.

Background[edit]
Numbers have long been used to identify types of boundary conditions.[1][2][3] The Green's function number system was proposed by Beck and Litkouhi in 1988[4] and has seen increasing use since then.[5][6][7][8][9] The number system has been used to catalog a large collection of Green’s functions and related solutions.[10][11] [12]
Although described here for solutions of the heat equation, this number system could also be used for any phenomena described by differential equations such as diffusion, acoustics, electromagnetics, fluid dynamics, etc.
Notation[edit]
The Green's function number specifies the coordinate system and the type of boundary conditions that a Green's function satisfies. The Green's function number has two parts, a letter designation followed by a number designation. The letter(s) designate the coordinate system while the numbers designate the type of boundary conditions that are satisfied.

Some of the designations for the Greens function number system are given next. Coordinate system designations include: X, Y, and Z for Cartesian coordinates; R, Z, 



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }

 for cylindrical coordinates; and, RS, 



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }

, 



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }

 for spherical coordinates. Designations for several boundary conditions are given in Table 1. The zeroth boundary condition is important for identifying the presence of a coordinate boundary where no physical boundary exists, for example, far away in a semi-infinite body or at the center of a cylindrical or spherical body.
Examples in Cartesian coordinates[edit]
X11[edit]
As an example, number X11 denotes the Green's function that satisfies the heat equation in the domain (0 < x < L) for boundary conditions of type 1 (Dirichlet) at both boundaries x = 0 and x = L. Here X denotes the Cartesian coordinate and 11 denotes the type 1 boundary condition at both sides of the body. The boundary value problem for the X11 Green’s function is given by
