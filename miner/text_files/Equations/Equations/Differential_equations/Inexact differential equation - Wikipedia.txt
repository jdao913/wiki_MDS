An inexact differential equation is a differential equation of the form





M
(
x
,
y
)

d
x
+
N
(
x
,
y
)

d
y
=
0
,

 where

≠

N


∂
x



.


{\displaystyle M(x,y)\,dx+N(x,y)\,dy=0,{\text{ where }}{\frac {\partial M}{\partial y}}\neq {\frac {\partial N}{\partial x}}.}



The solution to such equations came with the invention of the integrating factor by Leonhard Euler in 1739.[1]
Solution method[edit]
In order to solve the equation, we need to transform it into an exact differential equation. In order to do that, we need to find an integrating factor 



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

 to multiply the equation by. We'll start with the equation itself.



M

d
x
+
N

d
y
=
0


{\displaystyle M\,dx+N\,dy=0}

, so we get 



μ
M

d
x
+
μ
N

d
y
=
0


{\displaystyle \mu M\,dx+\mu N\,dy=0}

. We will require 



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

 to satisfy 






∂
μ
M


∂
y



=



∂
μ
N


∂
x





{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mu M}{\partial y}}={\frac {\partial \mu N}{\partial x}}}

. We get

μ


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mu }{\partial y}}M+{\frac {\partial M}{\partial y}}\mu ={\frac {\partial \mu }{\partial x}}N+{\frac {\partial N}{\partial x}}\mu }

. After simplifying we get

M

N

x


)
μ
=
0


{\displaystyle M\mu _{y}-N\mu _{x}+(M_{y}-N_{x})\mu =0}

. Since this is a partial differential equation, it is mostly extremely hard to solve, however in most cases we will get either 



μ
(
x
,
y
)
=
μ
(
x
)


{\displaystyle \mu (x,y)=\mu (x)}

 or 



μ
(
x
,
y
)
=
μ
(
y
)


{\displaystyle \mu (x,y)=\mu (y)}

, in which case we only need to find 



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

 with a first-order linear differential equation or a separable differential equation, and as such either 



μ
(
y
)
=

e

−
∫





M

−

N

M



d

{\displaystyle \mu (y)=e^{-\int {{\frac {M_{y}-N_{x}}{M}}\,dy}}}

 or

d

{\displaystyle \mu (x)=e^{\int {{\frac {M_{y}-N_{x}}{N}}\,dx}}}
