In differential geometry, Liouville's equation, named after Joseph Liouville, is the nonlinear partial differential equation satisfied by the conformal factor f of a metric f2(dx2 + dy2) on a surface of constant Gaussian curvature K:

{\displaystyle \Delta _{0}={\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}}+{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}}=4{\frac {\partial }{\partial z}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial {\bar {z}}}}.}



Liouville's equation appears in the study of isothermal coordinates in differential geometry: the independent variables x,y are the coordinates, while f can be described as the conformal factor with respect to the flat metric. Occasionally it is the square f2 that is referred to as the conformal factor, instead of f itself.
Liouville's equation was also taken as an example by David Hilbert in the formulation of his nineteenth problem.[1]

Other common forms of Liouville's equation[edit]
By using the change of variables log f ↦ u, another commonly found form of Liouville's equation is obtained:

{\displaystyle \Delta _{0}u=-Ke^{2u}.}



Other two forms of the equation, commonly found in the literature,[2] are obtained by using the slight variant 2 log f ↦ u of the previous change of variables and Wirtinger calculus:[3]

Note that it is exactly in the first one of the preceding two forms that Liouville's equation was cited by David Hilbert in the formulation of his nineteenth problem.[1][4]
A formulation using the Laplace–Beltrami operator[edit]
In a more invariant fashion, the equation can be written in terms of the intrinsic Laplace-Beltrami operator

Properties[edit]
Relation to Gauss–Codazzi equations[edit]
Liouville's equation is a consequence of the Gauss–Codazzi equations when the metric is written in isothermal coordinates.
General solution of the equation[edit]
In a simply connected domain Ω, the general solution of Liouville's equation can be found by using Wirtinger calculus.[5] Its form is given by

where f (z) is any meromorphic function such that

df/dz(z) ≠ 0 for every z ∈ Ω.[5]
f (z) has at most simple poles in Ω.[5]

Application[edit]
Liouville's equation can be used to prove the following classification results for surfaces:
Theorem.[6] A surface in the Euclidean 3-space with metric dl2 = g(z,_z)dzd_z, and with constant scalar curvature K is locally isometric to:

the sphere if K > 0;
the Euclidean plane if K = 0;
the Lobachevskian plane if K < 0.
