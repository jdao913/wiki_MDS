This template includes collapsible lists.




• To set it to display all lists when it appears (i.e. all lists expanded), use:
 {{Differential equations |expanded=all}} or, if enabled, {{Differential equations |all}}  (i.e. omitting "expanded=").








• To set it to display one particular list while keeping the remainder collapsed (i.e. hidden apart from their headings), use:
 {{Differential equations |expanded=listname}} or, if enabled, {{Differential equations |listname}}
…where listname is one of the following (do not include any quotemarks):
scope, types, processes, solution, "solution methods", people
For example, {{Differential equations |expanded=solution methods}} or, if enabled, {{Differential equations |solution methods}}
