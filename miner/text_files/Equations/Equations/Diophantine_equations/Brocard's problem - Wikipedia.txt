Not to be confused with Brocard's conjecture.



Unsolved problem in mathematics:
Does

{\displaystyle n!+1=m^{2}}

 have integer solutions other than

Brocard's problem is a problem in mathematics that asks to find integer values of n and m for which





n
!
+
1
=

m

2


,


{\displaystyle n!+1=m^{2},}



where n! is the factorial. It was posed by Henri Brocard in a pair of articles in 1876 and 1885, and independently in 1913 by Srinivasa Ramanujan.

Brown numbers[edit]
Pairs of the numbers (n, m) that solve Brocard's problem are called Brown numbers. There are only three known pairs of Brown numbers:

(4,5), (5,11), and (7,71).

Paul Erdős conjectured that no other solutions exist. Overholt (1993) showed that there are only finitely many solutions provided that the abc conjecture is true. Berndt & Galway (2000) performed calculations for n up to 109 and found no further solutions. Matson (2017) has recently claimed to have extended this by 3 orders of magnitude to one trillion.
Variants of the problem[edit]
Dabrowski (1996) generalized Overholt's result by showing that it would follow from the abc conjecture that





n
!
+
A
=

k

2




{\displaystyle n!+A=k^{2}}



has only finitely many solutions, for any given integer A. This result was further generalized by Luca (2002), who showed (again assuming the abc conjecture) that the equation





n
!
=
P
(
x
)


{\displaystyle n!=P(x)}



has only finitely many integer solutions for a given polynomial P(x) of degree at least 2 with integer coefficients.
