A drag count is a dimensionless unit used by aerospace engineers where 1 drag count is equal to a

{\displaystyle C_{d}}

 of 0.0001.[1][2]
Definition[edit]
A drag count

d






{\displaystyle \Delta C_{\mathrm {d} }\,}

 is defined as:

{\displaystyle \Delta C_{\mathrm {d} }=10^{4}{\dfrac {2F_{\mathrm {d} }}{\rho v^{2}A}}\,,}

 [3]

where:






F


d






{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {d} }\,}

 is the drag force, which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity,[4]




ρ



{\displaystyle \rho \,}

 is the mass density of the fluid,[5]




v



{\displaystyle v\,}

 is the speed of the object relative to the fluid and




A



{\displaystyle A\,}

 is the reference area.

The drag coefficient is used to compare the solutions of different geometries by means of a dimensionless number. A drag count is used as a more user-friendly measurement as the coefficient of drag is usually much less than 1. A drag count of 200 to 400 is typical for an airplane at cruise.[6] A reduction of one drag count on a subsonic civil transport airplane means about 200 lbs more in payload.[7]
