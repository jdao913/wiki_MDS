Mathematical form[edit]
Faraday's laws can be summarized by





m
 
=
 

(


Q
F


)


(


M
z


)



{\displaystyle m\ =\ \left({Q \over F}\right)\left({M \over z}\right)}



where:

m is the mass of the substance liberated at an electrode in gms
Q is the total electric charge passed through the substance in coulombs
F = 96485 C mol−1 is the Faraday constant
M is the molar mass of the substance in grams per mol
z is the valency number of ions of the substance (electrons transferred per ion).

Note that M/z is the same as the equivalent weight of the substance altered.
For Faraday's first law, M, F, and z are constants, so that the larger the value of Q the larger m will be.
For Faraday's second law, Q, F, and z are constants, so that the larger the value of M/z (equivalent weight) the larger m will be.
In the simple case of constant-current electrolysis, 



Q
=
I
t


{\displaystyle Q=It}

 leading to





m
 
=
 

(



I
t

F


)


(


M
z


)



{\displaystyle m\ =\ \left({It \over F}\right)\left({M \over z}\right)}



and then to





n
 
=
 

(



I
t

F


)


(


1
z


)



{\displaystyle n\ =\ \left({It \over F}\right)\left({1 \over z}\right)}



where:

n is the amount of substance ("number of moles") liberated: n = m/M
t is the total time the constant current was applied.

In the more complicated case of a variable electric current, the total charge Q is the electric current I(



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }

) integrated over time 



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }

:





Q
=

∫

0


t


I
(
τ
)
 
d
τ


{\displaystyle Q=\int _{0}^{t}I(\tau )\ d\tau }



Here t is the total electrolysis time.[2]
