In polymer science Flory–Rehner equation is an equation that describes the mixing of polymer and liquid molecules as predicted by the equilibrium swelling theory of Flory and Rehner.[1] It describes the equilibrium swelling of a lightly crosslinked polymer in terms of crosslink density and the quality of the solvent. The theory considers forces arising from three sources:[2]

The entropy change caused by mixing of polymer and solvent.
The entropy change caused by reduction in numbers of possible chain conformations via swelling.
The heat of mixing of polymer and solvent, which may be positive, negative, or zero.
