In Riemannian geometry, a Jacobi field is a vector field along a geodesic 



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }

 in a Riemannian manifold describing the difference between the geodesic and an "infinitesimally close" geodesic. In other words, the Jacobi fields along a geodesic form the tangent space to the geodesic in the space of all geodesics. They are named after Carl Jacobi.

Definitions and properties[edit]
Jacobi fields can be obtained in the following way: Take a smooth one parameter family of geodesics 




γ

τ




{\displaystyle \gamma _{\tau }}

 with 




γ

0


=
γ


{\displaystyle \gamma _{0}=\gamma }

, then





J

{\displaystyle J(t)=\left.{\frac {\partial \gamma _{\tau }(t)}{\partial \tau }}\right|_{\tau =0}}



is a Jacobi field, and describes the behavior of the geodesics in an infinitesimal neighborhood of a given geodesic 



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }

.
A vector field J along a geodesic 



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }

 is said to be a Jacobi field if it satisfies the Jacobi equation:

where D denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the Levi-Civita connection, R the Riemann curvature tensor,

{\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(t)=d\gamma (t)/dt}

 the tangent vector field, and t is the parameter of the geodesic. On a complete Riemannian manifold, for any Jacobi field there is a family of geodesics 




γ

τ




{\displaystyle \gamma _{\tau }}

 describing the field (as in the preceding paragraph).
The Jacobi equation is a linear, second order ordinary differential equation; in particular, values of 



J


{\displaystyle J}

 and 





D

d
t



J


{\displaystyle {\frac {D}{dt}}J}

 at one point of 



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }

 uniquely determine the Jacobi field. Furthermore, the set of Jacobi fields along a given geodesic forms a real vector space of dimension twice the dimension of the manifold.
As trivial examples of Jacobi fields one can consider 






γ
˙



(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(t)}

 and 



t



γ
˙



(
t
)


{\displaystyle t{\dot {\gamma }}(t)}

. These correspond respectively to the following families of reparametrisations:

{\displaystyle \gamma _{\tau }(t)=\gamma (\tau +t)}

 and

{\displaystyle \gamma _{\tau }(t)=\gamma ((1+\tau )t)}

.
Any Jacobi field 



J


{\displaystyle J}

 can be represented in a unique way as a sum 



T
+
I


{\displaystyle T+I}

, where 



T
=
a



γ

(
t

{\displaystyle T=a{\dot {\gamma }}(t)+bt{\dot {\gamma }}(t)}

 is a linear combination of trivial Jacobi fields and 



I
(
t
)


{\displaystyle I(t)}

 is orthogonal to 






γ
˙



(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}(t)}

, for all 



t


{\displaystyle t}

. The field 



I


{\displaystyle I}

 then corresponds to the same variation of geodesics as 



J


{\displaystyle J}

, only with changed parameterizations.
Motivating example[edit]
On a sphere, the geodesics through the North pole are great circles. Consider two such geodesics 




γ

0




{\displaystyle \gamma _{0}}

 and 




γ

τ




{\displaystyle \gamma _{\tau }}

 with natural parameter, 



t
∈
[
0
,
π
]


{\displaystyle t\in [0,\pi ]}

, separated by an angle 



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }

. The geodesic distance





d

{\displaystyle d(\gamma _{0}(t),\gamma _{\tau }(t))\,}



is

.


{\displaystyle d(\gamma _{0}(t),\gamma _{\tau }(t))=\sin ^{-1}{\bigg (}\sin t\sin \tau {\sqrt {1+\cos ^{2}t\tan ^{2}(\tau /2)}}{\bigg )}.}



Computing this requires knowing the geodesics. The most interesting information is just that





d

γ

γ

τ


(

)
=

{\displaystyle d(\gamma _{0}(\pi ),\gamma _{\tau }(\pi ))=0\,}

, for any 



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }

.

Instead, we can consider the derivative with respect to 



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }

 at 



τ
=
0


{\displaystyle \tau =0}

:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial \tau }}{\bigg |}_{\tau =0}d(\gamma _{0}(t),\gamma _{\tau }(t))=|J(t)|=\sin t.}



Notice that we still detect the intersection of the geodesics at 



t
=
π


{\displaystyle t=\pi }

. Notice further that to calculate this derivative we do not actually need to know

{\displaystyle d(\gamma _{0}(t),\gamma _{\tau }(t))\,}

rather, all we need do is solve the equation

{\displaystyle y''+y=0\,}

for some given initial data.
Jacobi fields give a natural generalization of this phenomenon to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds.

for each
