In this equation, ψc is the charge conjugate of ψ, which can be defined in the Majorana basis as

Properties[edit]
Similarity to Dirac equation[edit]
The Majorana is similar to the Dirac equation in the sense that it involves four-component spinors, gamma matrices and mass terms, but includes the charge conjugate ψc of a spinor ψ. In contrast, the Weyl equation is for two-component spinor without mass.
Charge conservation[edit]
The appearance of both ψ and ψc in the Majorana equation means that the field ψ cannot be coupled to a charged electromagnetic field without violating charge conservation, since particles have the opposite charge to their own antiparticles. To satisfy this restriction, ψ must be taken to be neutral.
Field quanta[edit]
The quanta of the Majorana equation allow for two classes of particles, a neutral particle and its neutral antiparticle. The frequently applied supplemental condition ψ = ψc results in a single neutral particle, in which case ψ is known as a Majorana spinor. For a Majorana spinor, the Majorana equation is equivalent to the Dirac equation.
Majorana particle[edit]
Main article: Majorana particle
Particles corresponding to Majorana spinors are known as Majorana particles, due to the above self-conjugacy constraint. All the fermions included in the Standard Model have been excluded as Majorana fermions (since they have non-zero electric charge they cannot be antiparticles of themselves) with the exception of the neutrino (which is neutral).
Theoretically, the neutrino is a possible exception to this pattern. If so, neutrinoless double-beta decay, as well as a range of lepton-number violating meson and charged lepton decays, are possible. A number of experiments probing whether the neutrino is a Majorana particle are currently underway.[2]
