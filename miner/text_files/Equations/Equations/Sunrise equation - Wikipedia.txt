A contour plot of the hours of daylight as a function of latitude and day of the year, using the most accurate models described in Sunrise equation, Latitude 40° N (approximately New York City, Madrid and Beijing) is highlighted for reference


The sunrise equation as follows can be used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset for any solar declination and latitude in terms of local solar time when sunrise and sunset actually occur:

Theory of the equation[edit]
The Earth rotates at an angular velocity of 15°/hour. Therefore, the expression

∘






{\displaystyle \omega _{\circ }\times {\frac {\mathrm {hour} }{{15}^{\circ }}}}

 gives the interval of time before and after local solar noon that sunrise or sunset will occur.
The sign convention is typically that the observer latitude 



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }

 is 0 at the Equator, positive for the Northern Hemisphere and negative for the Southern Hemisphere, and the solar declination 



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }

 is 0 at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes when the sun is exactly above the Equator, positive during the Northern Hemisphere summer and negative during the Northern Hemisphere winter.
The expression above is always applicable for latitudes between the Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle. North of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle, there is at least one day of the year with no sunrise or sunset. Formally, there is a sunrise or sunset when

Generalized equation[edit]
Also note that the above equation neglects the influence of atmospheric refraction (which lifts the solar disc by approximately 0.6° when it is on the horizon) and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc (about 0.5°). The times of the rising and the setting of the upper solar limb as given in astronomical almanacs correct for this by using the more general equation

The generalized equation relies on a number of other variables which need to be calculated before it can itself be calculated. These equations have the solar-earth constants substituted with angular constants expressed in degrees.

where:

C is the Equation of the center value needed to calculate lambda (see next equation).
1.9148 is the coefficient of the Equation of the Center for the planet the observer is on (in this case, Earth)

360


{\displaystyle \lambda =(M+C+180+102.9372)\mod 360}



where:

λ is the ecliptic longitude.
102.9372 is a value for the argument of perihelion.

(Amateur edit, so check before adopting). The value for the "Argument of Perihelion" is not constant, and changes (very slightly) per day. The JPL website gives the following for calculating the true value (valid to 3,000 AD): w0 = 102.9300589 degrees at J2000.0 and wt = 0.3179526 degrees per century (the amount by which this starting value changes see: https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf page 3 table 2a). Therefore, one needs to calculate the number of centuries since J2000.0 for the date in question and multiply wt by that value to get the true Argument of Perihelion for the Earth. On 31-Jan-2017 at around 11.0 a.m. London, the elapse time since J2000.0 in centuries el = 6240.0007892/36525 = 0.17084191, so w = w0 + wt * el = 102.984378. The difference is very small, but may make an error in sun rise or set of about a minute as of the example date. Note JPL use 36525 as the number of days in a century, not 36524.22. It seems to work OK.
