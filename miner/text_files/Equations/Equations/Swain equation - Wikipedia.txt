The Swain equation relates the kinetic isotope effect for the protium/tritium combination with that of the protium/deuterium combination according to:

1.442




{\displaystyle {\frac {k_{H}}{k_{T}}}=({\frac {k_{H}}{k_{D}}})^{1.442}}



where kH,D,T are the reaction rate constants for the protonated, deuterated and tritiated reactants respectively.
