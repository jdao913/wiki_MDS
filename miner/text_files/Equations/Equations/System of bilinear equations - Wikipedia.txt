In algebra, systems of bilinear equations are collections of equations, each one of which is written as a bilinear form, for which a common solution is sought. Given one set of variables represented as a vector x, and another represented by a vector y, then a system of bilinear equations for x and y can be written 




y

T



A

i


x
=

g

i




{\displaystyle y^{T}A_{i}x=g_{i}}

. Here, i is an integer whose value ranges from 1 to some upper bound r, the 




A

i




{\displaystyle A_{i}}

 are matrices and 




g

i




{\displaystyle g_{i}}

 are some real numbers. Systems of bilinear equations arise in many subjects including engineering, biology, and statistics.
Solving in integers[edit]
We consider here the solution theory for bilinear equations in integers. Let the given system of bilinear equation be

{\displaystyle {\begin{alignedat}{2}ax_{1}x_{2}+bx_{1}y_{2}+cx_{2}y_{1}+dy_{1}y_{2}&=&\alpha \\ex_{1}x_{2}+fx_{1}y_{2}+gx_{2}y_{1}+hy_{1}y_{2}&=&\beta \end{alignedat}}}



This system can be written as

Once we solve this linear system of equations then by using rank factorization below, we can get a solution for the given bilinear system.

{\displaystyle {\text{mat}}\left({\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}x_{2}\\x_{1}y_{2}\\y_{1}x_{2}\\y_{1}y_{2}\end{bmatrix}}\right)={\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}x_{2}&x_{1}y_{2}\\y_{1}x_{2}&y_{1}y_{2}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}\\y_{1}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}x_{2}&y_{2}\end{bmatrix}}.}



Now we solve the first equation by using the Smith normal form. Given any 



m
×
n


{\displaystyle m\times n}

 matrix 



A


{\displaystyle A}

, we can get two matrices 



U


{\displaystyle U}

 and 



V


{\displaystyle V}

 in 





SL


m


(

Z

)


{\displaystyle {\mbox{SL}}_{m}(\mathbb {Z} )}

 and 





SL


n


(

Z

)


{\displaystyle {\mbox{SL}}_{n}(\mathbb {Z} )}

, respectively such that 



U
A
V
=
D


{\displaystyle UAV=D}

, where 



D


{\displaystyle D}

 is as follows:





D

where 




d

{\displaystyle d_{i}>0}

 and 




d

{\displaystyle d_{i}|d_{i+1}}

 for 



i
=
1
,
2
,
…
,
s
−

{\displaystyle i=1,2,\ldots ,s-1}

. Given a system 



A


x


=


b




{\displaystyle A{\textbf {x}}={\textbf {b}}}

, we can rewrite it as 



D


y


=


c




{\displaystyle D{\textbf {y}}={\textbf {c}}}

, where 



V


y


=


x




{\displaystyle V{\textbf {y}}={\textbf {x}}}

 and 





c


=
U


b




{\displaystyle {\textbf {c}}=U{\textbf {b}}}

. Solving 



D


y


=


c




{\displaystyle D{\textbf {y}}={\textbf {c}}}

 is easier as the matrix 



D


{\displaystyle D}

 is somewhat diagonal. Since we are multiplying with some nonsingular matrices, the two systems of equations are equivalent in the sense that the solutions of one system have a one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of another system. We solve 



D


y


=


c




{\displaystyle D{\textbf {y}}={\textbf {c}}}

, and take 





x


=
V


y




{\displaystyle {\textbf {x}}=V{\textbf {y}}}

. Let the solution of 



D


y


=


c




{\displaystyle D{\textbf {y}}={\textbf {c}}}

 be







y


=


[




a

1







b

1






s




t



]




{\displaystyle {\textbf {y}}={\begin{bmatrix}a_{1}\\b_{1}\\s\\t\end{bmatrix}}}



where 



s
,
t
∈

Z



{\displaystyle s,t\in \mathbb {Z} }

 are free integers and these are all solutions of 



D


y


=


c




{\displaystyle D{\textbf {y}}={\textbf {c}}}

. So, any solution of 



A


x


=


b




{\displaystyle A{\textbf {x}}={\textbf {b}}}

 is 



V


y




{\displaystyle V{\textbf {y}}}

. Let 



V


{\displaystyle V}

 be given by





V
=


[

{\displaystyle V={\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}&a_{14}\\a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}&a_{24}\\a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}&a_{34}\\a_{41}&a_{42}&a_{43}&a_{44}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}A_{1}&B_{1}\\C_{1}&D_{1}\end{bmatrix}}.}



Then

 is

{\displaystyle M={\text{mat}}({\textbf {x}})={\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}a_{1}+a_{12}b_{1}+a_{13}s+a_{14}t&a_{31}a_{1}+a_{32}b_{1}+a_{33}s+a_{34}t\\a_{21}a_{1}+a_{22}b_{1}+a_{23}s+a_{24}t&a_{41}a_{1}+a_{42}b_{1}+a_{43}s+a_{44}t\end{bmatrix}}.}



We want matrix 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 to have rank 1 so that the factorization given in second equation can be done. Solving quadratic equations in 2 variables in integers will give us the solutions for a bilinear system. This method can be extended to any dimension, but at higher dimension solutions become more complicated. This algorithm can be applied in Sage or MATLAB.
