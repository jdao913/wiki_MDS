In the stochastic calculus, Tanaka's formula states that

Properties[edit]
Tanaka's formula is the explicit Doob–Meyer decomposition of the submartingale |Bt| into the martingale part (the integral on the right-hand side), and a continuous increasing process (local time). It can also be seen as the analogue of Itō's lemma for the (nonsmooth) absolute value function

{\displaystyle f''(x)=2\delta (x)}

; see local time for a formal explanation of the Itō term.
Outline of proof[edit]
The function |x| is not C2 in x at x = 0, so we cannot apply Itō's formula directly. But if we approximate it near zero (i.e. in [−ε, ε]) by parabolas

{\displaystyle {\frac {x^{2}}{2|\varepsilon |}}+{\frac {|\varepsilon |}{2}}.}



And using Itō's formula we can then take the limit as ε → 0, leading to Tanaka's formula.
