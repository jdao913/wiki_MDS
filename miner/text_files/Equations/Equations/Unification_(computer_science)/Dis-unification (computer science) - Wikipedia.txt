Dis-unification, in computer science and logic, is an algorithmic process of solving inequations between symbolic expressions.

"Anti-Unification" here refers to inequation-solving, a naming which nowadays has become quite unusual, cf. Anti-unification (computer science).

Comon shows that the first-order logic theory of equality and sort membership is decidable, that is, each first-order logic formula built from arbitrary function symbols, "=" and "∈", but no other predicates, can effectively be proven or disproven. Using the logical negation (¬), non-equality (≠) can be expressed in formulas, but order relations (<) cannot. As an application, he proves sufficient completeness of term rewriting systems.
