In combustion, the Williams spray equation, also known as the Williams–Boltzmann equation, describes the statistical evolution of sprays contained in another fluid, analogous to the kinetic theory of gases, named after Forman A. Williams, who derived the equation in 1958.[1]

Mathematical description[2][edit]
The sprays are assumed to be spherical with radius 



r


{\displaystyle r}

, even though the assumption is valid for solid particles(liquid droplets) when their shape has no consequence on the combustion. For liquid droplets to be nearly spherical, the spray has to be dilute(total volume occupied by the sprays is much less than the volume of the gas) and the Weber number

The equation is described by a number density function

A simplified model[edit]
This model for the rocket motor was developed by Probert,[4] Williams[5][6] and Tanasawa.[7][8] It is reasonable to neglect 




Q

j


,
 

Γ

j




{\displaystyle Q_{j},\ \Gamma _{j}}

, for distances not very close to the spray atomizer, where major portion of combustion occurs. Consider a one-dimensional liquid-propellent rocket motor situated at 



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}

, where fuel is sprayed. Neglecting 




E

j




{\displaystyle E_{j}}

(density function is defined without the temperature so accordingly dimensions of 




f

j




{\displaystyle f_{j}}

 changes) and due to the fact that the mean flow is parallel to 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 axis, the steady spray equation reduces to

where 




u

{\displaystyle u_{j}}

 is the velocity in

 direction. Integrating with respect to the velocity results

The contribution from the last term (spray acceleration term) becomes zero (using Divergence theorem) since

{\displaystyle f_{j}\rightarrow 0}

 is very large, which is typically the case in rocket motors. The drop size rate

where 




χ

{\displaystyle \chi _{j}}

 is independent of
