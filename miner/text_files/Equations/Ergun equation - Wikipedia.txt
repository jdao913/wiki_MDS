D

{\displaystyle D_{p}}

 is the equivalent spherical diameter of the packing,




ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }

 is the density of fluid,




μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid,





v

{\displaystyle v_{s}}

 is the superficial velocity (i.e. the velocity that the fluid would have through the empty tube at the same volumetric flow rate), and




ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }

 is the void fraction of the bed (bed porosity at any time).
Extension[edit]
The extension of the Ergun equation to fluidized beds is discussed by Akgiray and Saatçı (2001). To calculate the pressure drop in a given reactor, the following equation may be deduced

This arrangement of the Ergun equation makes clear its close relationship to the simpler Kozeny-Carman equation which describes laminar flow of fluids across packed beds.
