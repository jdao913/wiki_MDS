Euler's conjecture is a disproved conjecture in mathematics related to Fermat's last theorem. It was proposed by Leonhard Euler in 1769. It states that for all integers n and k greater than 1, if the sum of n kth powers of positive integers is itself a kth power, then n is greater than or equal to k.
The conjecture represents an attempt to generalize Fermat's last theorem, which is the special case n = 2: if a1k + a2k = bk, then 2 ≥ k.
Although the conjecture holds for the case k = 3 (which follows from Fermat's last theorem for the third powers), it was disproved for k = 4 and k = 5. It is unknown whether the conjecture fails or holds for any value k ≥ 6.

Background[edit]
Euler was aware of the equality 594 + 1584 = 1334 + 1344 involving sums of four fourth powers; this however is not a counterexample because no term is isolated on one side of the equation. He also provided a complete solution to the four cubes problem as in Plato's number 33 + 43 + 53 = 63 or the taxicab number 1729.[1][2] The general solution of the equation

where a and b are any integers.
Counterexamples[edit]
Euler's conjecture was disproven by L. J. Lander and T. R. Parkin in 1966 when, through a direct computer search on a CDC 6600, they found a counterexample for k = 5.[3] A total of three primitive (that is, in which the summands do not all have a common factor) counterexamples are known:



275 + 845 + 1105 + 1335 = 1445 (Lander & Parkin, 1966),
(−220)5 + 50275 + 62375 + 7004140680000000000♠140685 = 7004141320000000000♠141325 (Scher & Seidl, 1996), and
555 + 31835 + 7004289690000000000♠289695 + 7004852820000000000♠852825 = 7004853590000000000♠853595 (Frye, 2004).



In 1986, Noam Elkies found a method to construct an infinite series of counterexamples for the k = 4 case.[4] His smallest counterexample was



7006268244000000000♠26824404 + 7007153656390000000♠153656394 + 7007187967600000000♠187967604 = 7007206156730000000♠206156734.



A particular case of Elkies' solutions can be reduced to the identity[5][6]



(85v2 + 484v − 313)4 + (68v2 − 586v + 10)4 + (2u)4 = (357v2 − 204v + 363)4



where



u2 = 7004220300000000000♠22030 + 7004288490000000000♠28849v − 7004561580000000000♠56158v2 + 7004369410000000000♠36941v3 − 7004317900000000000♠31790v4.



This is an elliptic curve with a rational point at v1 = −31/467. From this initial rational point, one can compute an infinite collection of others. Substituting v1 into the identity and removing common factors gives the numerical example cited above.
In 1988, Roger Frye found the smallest possible counterexample



7004958000000000000♠958004 + 7005217519000000000♠2175194 + 7005414560000000000♠4145604 = 7005422481000000000♠4224814



for k = 4 by a direct computer search using techniques suggested by Elkies. This solution is the only one with values of the variables below 1,000,000.[7]
Generalizations[edit]
Main article: Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge conjecture
In 1967, L. J. Lander, T. R. Parkin, and John Selfridge conjectured[8] that if k > 3 and

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{k}=\sum _{j=1}^{m}b_{j}^{k}}

,

where ai ≠ bj are positive integers for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m, then m + n ≥ k. In the special case m = 1, the conjecture states that if

(under the conditions given above) then n ≥ k − 1.
The special case may be described as the problem of giving a partition of a perfect power into few like powers. For k = 4, 5, 7, 8 and n = k or k − 1, there are many known solutions. Some of these are listed below. There are no solutions for k = 6 where b ≤ 7005272580000000000♠272580.[citation needed]
k = 3[edit]

The number 2 100 0003 can be expressed as the sum of three cubes in nine different ways.[9]

k = 4[edit]



7004958000000000000♠958004 + 7005217519000000000♠2175194 + 7005414560000000000♠4145604 = 7005422481000000000♠4224814 (R. Frye, 1988)[4]






304 + 1204 + 2724 + 3154 = 3534 (R. Norrie, 1911)[8]



This is the smallest solution to the problem by R. Norrie.
k = 5[edit]



275 + 845 + 1105 + 1335 = 1445 (Lander & Parkin, 1966)






195 + 435 + 465 + 475 + 675 = 725 (Lander, Parkin, Selfridge, smallest, 1967)[8]






75 + 435 + 575 + 805 + 1005 = 1075 (Sastry, 1934, third smallest)[8]



k = 7[edit]



1277 + 2587 + 2667 + 4137 + 4307 + 4397 + 5257 = 5687 (M. Dodrill, 1999)[citation needed]



k = 8[edit]



908 + 2238 + 4788 + 5248 + 7488 + 10888 + 11908 + 13248 = 14098 (S. Chase, 2000)[citation needed]
