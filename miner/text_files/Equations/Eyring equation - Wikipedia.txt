The Eyring equation (occasionally also known as Eyring–Polanyi equation) is an equation used in chemical kinetics to describe the variance of the rate of a chemical reaction with temperature. It was developed almost simultaneously in 1935 by Henry Eyring, Meredith Gwynne Evans and Michael Polanyi. This equation follows from the transition state theory (a.k.a. activated-complex theory) and is trivially equivalent to the empirical Arrhenius equation which are both readily derived from statistical thermodynamics in the kinetic theory of gases.[1]

General form[edit]
The general form of the Eyring–Polanyi equation somewhat resembles the Arrhenius equation:

{\displaystyle \ k={\frac {k_{\mathrm {B} }T}{h}}\mathrm {e} ^{-{\frac {\Delta G^{\ddagger }}{RT}}}}


where ΔG‡ is the Gibbs energy of activation, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and h is Planck's constant.
It can be rewritten as:

Accuracy[edit]
Transition state theory requires a value of a certain transmission coefficient, called 



 
κ


{\displaystyle \ \kappa }

 in that theory, as an additional prefactor in the Eyring equation above. This value is usually taken to be unity (i.e., the transition state 



 
A

B

‡




{\displaystyle \ AB^{\ddagger }}

 always proceeds to products 



 
A
B


{\displaystyle \ AB}

 and never reverts to reactants 



 
A


{\displaystyle \ A}

 and 



 
B


{\displaystyle \ B}

), and we have followed this convention above. Alternatively, to avoid specifying a value of 



 
κ


{\displaystyle \ \kappa }

, the ratios of rate constants can be compared to the value of a rate constant at some fixed reference temperature (i.e., 



 
k

)


{\displaystyle \ k(T)/k(T_{Ref})}

) which eliminates the

 term in the resulting expression.
