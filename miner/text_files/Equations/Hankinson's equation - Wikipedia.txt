Hankinson's equation (also called Hankinson's formula or Hankinson's criterion)[1] is a mathematical relationship for predicting the off-axis uniaxial compressive strength of wood. The formula can also be used to compute the fiber stress or the stress wave velocity at the elastic limit as a function of grain angle in wood. For a wood that has uniaxial compressive strengths of 




σ

0




{\displaystyle \sigma _{0}}

 parallel to the grain and 




σ

90




{\displaystyle \sigma _{90}}

 perpendicular to the grain, Hankinson's equation predicts that the uniaxial compressive strength of the wood in a direction at an angle 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 to the grain is given by

Even though the original relation was based on studies of spruce, Hankinson's equation has been found to be remarkably accurate for many other types of wood. A generalized form of the Hankinson formula has also been used for predicting the uniaxial tensile strength of wood at an angle to the grain. This formula has the form[2]

where the exponent

 can take values between 1.5 and 2.
The stress wave velocity at angle
