In Einstein's theory of general relativity, the interior Schwarzschild metric (also interior Schwarzschild solution or Schwarzschild fluid solution) is an exact solution for the gravitational field in the interior of a non-rotating spherical body which consists of an incompressible fluid (implying that density is constant throughout the body) and has zero pressure at the surface. This is a static solution, meaning that it does not change over time. It was discovered by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, who earlier had found the exterior Schwarzschild metric.[1]

Spherical coordinates


The interior Schwarzschild metric is framed in a spherical coordinate system with the body's centre located at the origin, plus the time coordinate. Its line element is[2][3]

κ

c

{\displaystyle \kappa =8\pi G/c^{2}}

 is Einstein's constant.[3][5] It may be counterintuitive that the density is the mass divided by the volume of a sphere with radius 




r

g




{\displaystyle r_{g}}

, which seems to disregard that this is less than the proper radius, and that space inside the body is curved so that the volume formula for a "flat" sphere shouldn't hold at all. However, 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 is the mass measured from the outside, for example by observing a test particle orbiting the gravitating body (the "Kepler mass"), which in general relativity is not necessarily equal to the proper mass. This mass difference exactly cancels out the difference of the volumes.
Pressure and stability[edit]
The pressure of the incompressible fluid can be found by calculating the Einstein tensor 




G

μ
ν




{\displaystyle G_{\mu \nu }}

 from the metric. The Einstein tensor is diagonal (i.e., all off-diagonal elements are zero), meaning there are no shear stresses, and has equal values for the three spatial diagonal components, meaning pressure is isotropic. Its value is

{\displaystyle p=\rho c^{2}{\frac {\cos \eta -\cos \eta _{g}}{3\cos \eta _{g}-\cos \eta }}.}



As expected, the pressure is zero at the surface of the sphere and increases towards the centre. It becomes infinite at the centre if

, which is true for a body that is extremely dense or large. Such a body suffers gravitational collapse into a black hole. As this is a time dependent process, the Schwarzschild solution does not hold any longer.[2][3]
Redshift[edit]
Gravitational redshift for radiation from the sphere's surface (for example, light from a star) is

Visualization[edit]




Embedding of a Schwarzschild metric's slice in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The interior solution is the darker cap at the bottom.
This embedding should not be confused with the unrelated concept of a gravity well.


The spatial curvature of the interior Schwarzschild metric can be visualized by taking a slice (1) with constant time and (2) through the sphere's equator, i.e.

. As the exterior metric can be embedded in the same way (yielding Flamm's paraboloid), a slice of the complete solution can be drawn like this:[5][6]



In this graphic, the blue circular arc represents the interior metric, and the black parabolic arcs with the equation

{\displaystyle w=2{\sqrt {r_{s}(r-r_{s})}}}

-coordinate is the angle measured from the centre of the cap, that is, from "above" the slice. The proper radius of the sphere – intuitively, the length of a measuring rod spanning from its centre to a point on its surface – is half the length of the circular arc, or

This is a purely geometric visualization and does not imply a physical "fourth spatial dimension" into which space would be curved. (Intrinsic curvature does not imply extrinsic curvature.)

Here are the relevant parameters for some astronomical objects, disregarding rotation and inhomogeneities such as deviation from the spherical shape and variation in density.

History[edit]
The interior Schwarzschild solution was the first static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solution that was found. It was published on 24 February 1916, only three months after Einstein's field equations and one month after Schwarzschild's exterior solution.[1][2]
