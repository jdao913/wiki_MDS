Jet bundle - Wikipedia

In differential topology, the jet bundle is a certain construction that makes a new smooth fiber bundle out of a given smooth fiber bundle. It makes it possible to write differential equations on sections of a fiber bundle in an invariant form. Jets may also be seen as the coordinate free versions of Taylor expansions.
Historically, jet bundles are attributed to Ehresmann, and were an advance on the method (prolongation) of Élie Cartan, of dealing geometrically with higher derivatives, by imposing differential form conditions on newly introduced formal variables. Jet bundles are sometimes called sprays, although sprays usually refer more specifically to the associated vector field induced on the corresponding bundle (e.g., the geodesic spray on Finsler manifolds.)
More recently, jet bundles have appeared as a concise way to describe phenomena associated with the derivatives of maps, particularly those associated with the calculus of variations. Consequently, the jet bundle is now recognized as the correct domain for a geometrical covariant field theory and much work is done in general relativistic formulations of fields using this approach.

Suppose M is an m-dimensional manifold and that (E, π, M) is a fiber bundle. For p ∈ M, let Γ(p) denote the set of all local sections whose domain contains p. Let

The relation that two maps have the same r-jet is an equivalence relation. An r-jet is an equivalence class under this relation, and the r-jet with representative σ is denoted 




j

p


r


σ


{\displaystyle j_{p}^{r}\sigma }

. The integer r is also called the order of the jet, p is its source and σ(p) is its target.
Jet manifolds[edit]
The r-th jet manifold of π is the set

{\displaystyle J^{r}(\pi )=\left\{j_{p}^{r}\sigma :p\in M,\sigma \in \Gamma (p)\right\}.}



We may define projections πr and πr,0 called the source and target projections respectively, by

If 1 ≤ k ≤ r, then the k-jet projection is the function πr,k defined by

{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}\pi _{r,k}:J^{r}(\pi )\to J^{k}(\pi )\\j_{p}^{r}\sigma \mapsto j_{p}^{k}\sigma \end{cases}}}



From this definition, it is clear that πr = π o πr,0 and that if 0 ≤ m ≤ k, then πr,m = πk,m o πr,k. It is conventional to regard πr,r as the identity map on J r(π) and to identify J 0(π) with E.
The functions πr,k, πr,0 and πr are smooth surjective submersions.



A coordinate system on E will generate a coordinate system on J r(π). Let (U, u) be an adapted coordinate chart on E, where u = (xi, uα). The induced coordinate chart (Ur, ur) on J r(π) is defined by

Given an atlas of adapted charts (U, u) on E, the corresponding collection of charts (U r, u r) is a finite-dimensional C∞ atlas on J r(π).
Jet bundles[edit]
Since the atlas on each Jr(π) defines a manifold, the triples (Jr(π), πr,k, Jk(π)), (Jr(π), πr,0, E) and (Jr(π), πr, M) all define fibered manifolds. In particular, if (E, π, M) is a fiber bundle, the triple (Jr(π), πr, M) defines the r-th jet bundle of π.

Example[edit]
If π is the trivial bundle (M × R, pr1, M), then there is a canonical diffeomorphism between the first jet bundle J1(π) and T*M × R. To construct this diffeomorphism, for each σ in ΓM(π) write

{\displaystyle j_{p}^{1}\sigma =\{\psi :\psi \in \Gamma _{p}(\pi );{\bar {\psi }}(p)={\bar {\sigma }}(p);d{\bar {\psi }}_{p}=d{\bar {\sigma }}_{p}\}.\,}



Consequently, the mapping

is well-defined and is clearly injective. Writing it out in coordinates shows that it is a diffeomorphism, because if (xi, u) are coordinates on M × R, where u = idR is the identity coordinate, then the derivative coordinates ui on J1(π) correspond to the coordinates ∂i on T*M.
Likewise, if π is the trivial bundle (R × M, pr1, R), then there exists a canonical diffeomorphism between J1(π) and R × TM.
Contact structure[edit]
The space Jr(π) carries a natural distribution, that is, a sub-bundle of the tangent bundle TJr(π)), called the Cartan distribution. The Cartan distribution is spanned by all tangent planes to graphs of holonomic sections; that is, sections of the form jrφ for φ a section of π.
The annihilator of the Cartan distribution is a space of differential one-forms called contact forms, on Jr(π). The space of differential one-forms on Jr(π) is denoted by 




Λ

1



J

r


(
π
)


{\displaystyle \Lambda ^{1}J^{r}(\pi )}

 and the space of contact forms is denoted by 




Λ

C


r


π


{\displaystyle \Lambda _{C}^{r}\pi }

. A one form is a contact form provided its pullback along every prolongation is zero. In other words, 



θ
∈

Λ

J

π


{\displaystyle \theta \in \Lambda ^{1}J^{r}\pi }

j

r

σ

)

∗


θ
=

{\displaystyle (j^{r+1}\sigma )^{*}\theta =0}



for all local sections σ of π over M.
The Cartan distribution is the main geometrical structure on jet spaces and plays an important role in the geometric theory of partial differential equations. The Cartan distributions are completely non-integrable. In particular, they are not involutive. The dimension of the Cartan distribution grows with the order of the jet space. However, on the space of infinite jets J∞ the Cartan distribution becomes involutive and finite-dimensional: its dimension coincides with the dimension of the base manifold M.
Example[edit]
Let us consider the case (E, π, M), where E ≃ R2 and M ≃ R. Then, (J1(π), π, M) defines the first jet bundle, and may be coordinated by (x, u, u1), where

Partial differential equations[edit]
Let (E, π, M) be a fiber bundle. An r-th order partial differential equation on π is a closed embedded submanifold S of the jet manifold Jr(π). A solution is a local section σ ∈ ΓW(π) satisfying

Let us consider an example of a first order partial differential equation.

Jet Prolongation[edit]
A local diffeomorphism ψ : Jr(π) → Jr(π) defines a contact transformation of order r if it preserves the contact ideal, meaning that if θ is any contact form on Jr(π), then ψ*θ is also a contact form.
The flow generated by a vector field Vr on the jet space Jr(π) forms a one-parameter group of contact transformations if and only if the Lie derivative 






L

Therefore, V1 determines a contact transformation if and only if the coefficients of dxi and

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \phi ^{\alpha }}{\partial u_{i}^{k}}}-u_{l}^{\alpha }{\frac {\partial \rho ^{l}}{\partial u_{i}^{k}}}=0}



The former requirements provide explicit formulae for the coefficients of the first derivative terms in V1:

Thus, the contact conditions uniquely prescribe the prolongation of any point or contact vector field. That is, if 






L




V

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{V^{r}}}

 satisfies these equations, Vr is called the r-th prolongation of V to a vector field on Jr(π).
These results are best understood when applied to a particular example. Hence, let us examine the following.
Example[edit]
Let us consider the case (E, π, M), where E ≅ R2 and M ≃ R. Then, (J1(π), π, E) defines the first jet bundle, and may be coordinated by (x, u, u1), where

for all p ∈ M and σ in Γp(π). A contact form on J1(π) has the form





θ

{\displaystyle \theta =du-u_{1}dx}



Let us consider a vector V on E, having the form





V

∂

∂

−
u


∂

∂

{\displaystyle V=x{\frac {\partial }{\partial u}}-u{\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}}



Then, the first prolongation of this vector field to J1(π) is

Let us also calculate the second prolongation of V to a vector field on J2(π). We have 



{
x
,
u
,

u

1


,

y

2


}


{\displaystyle \{x,u,u_{1},y_{2}\}}

 as coordinates on J2(π). Hence, the prolonged vector has the form

The contacts forms are

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\theta &=du-u_{1}dx\\\theta _{1}&=du_{1}-u_{2}dx\end{aligned}}}



To preserve the contact ideal, we require








L




V

(
θ

=

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{V^{2}}(\theta )=0}









L




V

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{V^{2}}(\theta _{1})=0}



Now, θ has no u2 dependency. Hence, from this equation we will pick up the formula for ρ, which will necessarily be the same result as we found for V1. Therefore, the problem is analogous to prolonging the vector field V1 to J2(π). That is to say, we may generate the r-th prolongation of a vector field by recursively applying the Lie derivative of the contact forms with respect to the prolonged vector fields, r times. So, we have





ρ

x

u

u

{\displaystyle \rho (x,u,u_{1})=1+u_{1}u_{1}}



and so

Hence, for

 to preserve the contact ideal, we require

{\displaystyle 3u_{1}u_{2}-\phi (x,u,u_{1},u_{2})=0\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \phi (x,u,u_{1},u_{2})=3u_{1}u_{2}.}



And so the second prolongation of V to a vector field on J2(π) is

Note that the first prolongation of V can be recovered by omitting the second derivative terms in V2, or by projecting back to J1(π).
Infinite Jet Spaces[edit]

(
π
)
→

J

k


(
π
)


{\displaystyle \pi _{k+1,k}:J^{k+1}(\pi )\to J^{k}(\pi )}

 gives rise to the infinite jet space J∞(π). A point 




j

p


∞


(
σ
)


{\displaystyle j_{p}^{\infty }(\sigma )}

 is the equivalence class of sections of π that have the same k-jet in p as σ for all values of k. The natural projection π∞ maps 




j

p


∞


(
σ
)


{\displaystyle j_{p}^{\infty }(\sigma )}

 into p.
Just by thinking in terms of coordinates, J∞(π) appears to be an infinite-dimensional geometric object. In fact, the simplest way of introducing a differentiable structure on J∞(π), not relying on differentiable charts, is given by the differential calculus over commutative algebras. Dual to the sequence of projections

{\displaystyle \pi _{k+1,k}^{*}:C^{\infty }(J^{k}(\pi ))\to C^{\infty }(J^{k+1}(\pi ))}

 of commutative algebras. Let's denote 




C

∞


(

J

k


(
π
)
)


{\displaystyle C^{\infty }(J^{k}(\pi ))}

 simply by 






F



k


(
π
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}_{k}(\pi )}

. Take now the direct limit 





F


(
π
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}(\pi )}

 of the 






F



k


(
π
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}_{k}(\pi )}

's. It will be a commutative algebra, which can be assumed to be the smooth functions algebra over the geometric object J∞(π). Observe that 





F


(
π
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}(\pi )}

, being born as a direct limit, carries an additional structure: it is a filtered commutative algebra.
Roughly speaking, a concrete element 



φ
∈


F


(
π
)


{\displaystyle \varphi \in {\mathcal {F}}(\pi )}

 will always belong to some 






F



k


(
π
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}_{k}(\pi )}

, so it is a smooth function on the finite-dimensional manifold Jk(π) in the usual sense.
Infinitely prolonged PDEs[edit]
Given a k-th order system of PDEs E ⊆ Jk(π), the collection I(E) of vanishing on E smooth functions on J∞(π) is an ideal in the algebra 






F



k


(
π
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}_{k}(\pi )}

, and hence in the direct limit 





F


(
π
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}(\pi )}

 too.
Enhance I(E) by adding all the possible compositions of total derivatives applied to all its elements. This way we get a new ideal I of 





F


(
π
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}(\pi )}

 which is now closed under the operation of taking total derivative. The submanifold E(∞) of J∞(π) cut out by I is called the infinite prolongation of E.
Geometrically, E(∞) is the manifold of formal solutions of E. A point 




j

p


∞


(
σ
)


{\displaystyle j_{p}^{\infty }(\sigma )}

 of E(∞) can be easily seen to be represented by a section σ whose k-jet's graph is tangent to E at the point 




j

p


k


(
σ
)


{\displaystyle j_{p}^{k}(\sigma )}

 with arbitrarily high order of tangency.
Analytically, if E is given by φ = 0, a formal solution can be understood as the set of Taylor coefficients of a section σ in a point p that make vanish the Taylor series of 



φ
∘

j

k


(
σ
)


{\displaystyle \varphi \circ j^{k}(\sigma )}

 at the point p.
Most importantly, the closure properties of I imply that E(∞) is tangent to the infinite-order contact structure 





C




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}

 on J∞(π), so that by restricting 





C




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}

 to E(∞) one gets the diffiety 



(

E

,


C

E

)


{\displaystyle (E_{(\infty )},{\mathcal {C}}|_{E_{(\infty )}})}

, and can study the associated C-spectral sequence.
Remark[edit]
This article has defined jets of local sections of a bundle, but it is possible to define jets of functions f: M → N, where M and N are manifolds; the jet of f then just corresponds to the jet of the section

grf: M → M × N
grf(p) = (p, f(p))

(grf is known as the graph of the function f) of the trivial bundle (M × N, π1, M). However, this restriction does not simplify the theory, as the global triviality of π does not imply the global triviality of π1.
