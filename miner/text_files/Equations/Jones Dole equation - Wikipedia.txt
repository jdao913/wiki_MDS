The Jones Dole equation or Jones Dole expression describes the relationship between the viscosity of an aqueous salt solution and the concentration of salt within the solution (at a fixed temperature and pressure).[1]
The Jones Dole equation is written as:

{\displaystyle {\frac {n(aq)}{n_{l}^{*}(l)}}=1+AC^{\frac {1}{2}}+BC}


where

n(aq) is the viscosity of the aqueous salt solution (at a fixed temperature and pressure)
nl*(l) is the viscosity of water at the same temperature and pressure
A is a coefficient that describes the impact of charge-charge interactions on the viscosity of a solution (it is usually positive)
C is the concentration of the salt
B is a coefficient which characterises the ion-solvent interactions at a defined temperature and pressure. It is interpreted as a measure of the structure forming and structure-breaking capacity of an ion in solution.
