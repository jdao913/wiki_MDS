The Kasner metric (developed by and named for the American mathematician Edward Kasner in 1921)[1] is an exact solution to Einstein's theory of general relativity. It describes an anisotropic universe without matter (i.e., it is a vacuum solution). It can be written in any spacetime dimension 



D
>
3


{\displaystyle D>3}

 and has strong connections with the study of gravitational chaos.

and contains

{\displaystyle D-1}

 constants 




p

, called the Kasner exponents. The metric describes a spacetime whose equal-time slices are spatially flat, however space is expanding or contracting at different rates in different directions, depending on the values of the 




p

j




{\displaystyle p_{j}}

. Test particles in this metric whose comoving coordinate differs by 



Δ

j




{\displaystyle \Delta x^{j}}

 are separated by a physical distance

The Kasner metric is an exact solution to Einstein's equations in vacuum when the Kasner exponents satisfy the following Kasner conditions,






∑

p

{\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{D-1}p_{j}^{2}=1.}



The first condition defines a plane, the Kasner plane, and the second describes a sphere, the Kasner sphere. The solutions (choices of 




p

j




{\displaystyle p_{j}}

) satisfying the two conditions therefore lie on the sphere where the two intersect (sometimes confusingly also called the Kasner sphere). In 



D


{\displaystyle D}

 spacetime dimensions, the space of solutions therefore lie on a 



D

{\displaystyle D-3}

 dimensional sphere

Features[edit]
There are several noticeable and unusual features of the Kasner solution:

The volume of the spatial slices is always 



O
(
t
)


{\displaystyle O(t)}

. This is because their volume is proportional to 





−
g




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {-g}}}

, and

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {-g}}=t^{p_{1}+p_{2}+\cdots +p_{D-1}}=t}






where we have used the first Kasner condition. Therefore 



t
→
0


{\displaystyle t\to 0}

 can describe either a Big Bang or a Big Crunch, depending on the sense of 



t


{\displaystyle t}




Isotropic expansion or contraction of space is not allowed. If the spatial slices were expanding isotropically, then all of the Kasner exponents must be equal, and therefore 




p

j

/

(
D

)


{\displaystyle p_{j}=1/(D-1)}

 to satisfy the first Kasner condition. But then the second Kasner condition cannot be satisfied, for

{\displaystyle \sum _{j=1}^{D-1}p_{j}^{2}={\frac {1}{D-1}}\neq 1.}






The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric employed in cosmology, by contrast, is able to expand or contract isotropically because of the presence of matter.


With a little more work, one can show that at least one Kasner exponent is always negative (unless we are at one of the solutions with a single 




p

j


=
1


{\displaystyle p_{j}=1}

, and the rest vanishing). Suppose we take the time coordinate 



t


{\displaystyle t}

 to increase from zero. Then this implies that while the volume of space is increasing like 



t


{\displaystyle t}

, at least one direction (corresponding to the negative Kasner exponent) is actually contracting.
The Kasner metric is a solution to the vacuum Einstein equations, and so the Ricci tensor always vanishes for any choice of exponents satisfying the Kasner conditions. The full Riemann tensor vanishes only when a single 




p

j


=
1


{\displaystyle p_{j}=1}

 and the rest vanish, in which case the space is flat. The Minkowski metric can be recovered via the coordinate transformation
