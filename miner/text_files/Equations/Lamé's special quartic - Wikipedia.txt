Lamé's special quartic with "radius" 1.


Lamé's special quartic is the graph of the equation

r

{\displaystyle x^{4}+y^{4}=r^{4}}



where 



r

{\displaystyle r>0}

.[1] It looks like a rounded square with "sides" of length

r


{\displaystyle 2r}

 and centered on the origin. This curve is a squircle centered on the origin, and it is a special case of a superellipse.[2]
Because of Pierre de Fermat's only surviving proof, that of the n = 4 case of Fermat's Last Theorem, if r is rational there is no non-trivial rational point (x, y) on this curve (that is, no point for which both x and y are non-zero rational numbers).
