A graph of a leaky integrator; the input changes at T=5.


In mathematics, a leaky integrator equation is a specific differential equation, used to describe a component or system that takes the integral of an input, but gradually leaks a small amount of input over time. It appears commonly in hydraulics, electronics, and neuroscience where it can represent either a single neuron or a local population of neurons.[1] [clarification needed]
This is equivalent to a 1st-order lowpass filter with cutoff frequency far below the frequencies of interest.[citation needed]
Equation[edit]
The equation is of the form





d
x

/

d
t
=
−
A
x
+
C


{\displaystyle dx/dt=-Ax+C}



where C is the input and A is the rate of the 'leak'.
General solution[edit]
As the equation is a nonhomogeneous first-order linear differential equation, its general solution is





x
(
t
)
=
k

e

−
A
t


+

x

0


(
t
)


{\displaystyle x(t)=ke^{-At}+x_{0}(t)}



where 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 is a constant, and 




x

0




{\displaystyle x_{0}}

 is an arbitrary solution of the equation.
