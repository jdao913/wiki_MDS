A Levich constant (B) is often used in order to simplify the Levich equation.[1] Furthermore, B is readily extracted from rotating disk electrode experimental data.
The B can be defined as:[2]




B
=
(
0.620
)
n
F
A

D


2
3




v



−
1

6



C


{\displaystyle B=(0.620)nFAD^{\frac {2}{3}}v^{\frac {-1}{6}}C}


where

n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the half reaction (number)
F is the Faraday constant (C/mol)
A is the electrode area (cm2)
D is the diffusion coefficient (see Fick's law of diffusion) (cm2/s)
v is the kinematic viscosity (cm2/s)
C is the analyte concentration (mol/cm3)
