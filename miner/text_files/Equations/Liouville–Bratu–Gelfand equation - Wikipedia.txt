In mathematics, Liouville–Bratu–Gelfand equation or Liouville's equation is a non-linear eigenvalue Poisson equation, named after the mathematicians Joseph Liouville,[1] G. Bratu[2] and Israel Gelfand.[3] The equation reads

=

{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\psi +\lambda e^{\psi }=0}



The equation appears in thermal runaway as Frank-Kamenetskii theory, astrophysics for example, Chandrasekhar equation. This equation also describes space charge of electricity round a glowing wire[4] and describes planetary nebula.
Liouville's solution[5][edit]
In two dimension with Cartesian Coordinates

, Joseph Liouville proposed a solution in 1853 as

{\displaystyle \lambda e^{\psi }(u^{2}+v^{2}+1)^{2}=2\left[\left({\frac {\partial u}{\partial x}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}\right)^{2}\right]}



where

{\displaystyle f(z)=u+iv}

 is an arbitrary analytic function with 



z

{\displaystyle z=x+iy}

. In 1915, G.W. Walker[6] found a solution by assuming a form for

where

 is some finite radius. This solution decays at infinity for any

{\displaystyle n<1}

 , becomes finite at the origin for 



n

{\displaystyle n=1}

 and becomes zero at the origin for 



n

{\displaystyle n>1}

. Walker also proposed two more solutions in 1915 paper.
Radially symmetric forms[edit]

 infinitely many solution exists with solutions oscillating about the point 



λ

{\displaystyle \lambda =2(n-2)}

. For
