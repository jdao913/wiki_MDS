In the study of differential equations, the Loewy decomposition breaks every linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) into what are called largest completely reducible components. It was introduced by Alfred Loewy.[1]
Solving differential equations is one of the most important subfields in mathematics. Of particular interest are solutions in closed form. Breaking ODEs into largest irreducible components, reduces the process of solving the original equation to solving irreducible equations of lowest possible order. This procedure is algorithmic, so that the best possible answer for solving a reducible equation is guaranteed. A detailed discussion may be found in.[2]
Loewy's results have been extended to linear partial differential equations (PDEs) in two independent variables. In this way, algorithmic methods for solving large classes of linear pde's have become available.

Decomposing linear ordinary differential equations[edit]
Let

{\displaystyle D\equiv {\frac {d}{dx}}}

 denote the derivative w.r.t. the variable 



x


{\displaystyle x}

. A differential operator of order 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is a polynomial of the form

where the coefficients

, 



i
=
1
,
…
,
n


{\displaystyle i=1,\ldots ,n}

 are from some function field, the base field of 



L


{\displaystyle L}

. Usually it is the field of rational functions in the variable 



x


{\displaystyle x}

, i.e. 




a

i


∈


Q


(
x
)


{\displaystyle a_{i}\in {\mathbb {Q} }(x)}

. If 



y


{\displaystyle y}

 is an indeterminate with 






d

≠
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}\neq 0}

, 



L
y


{\displaystyle Ly}

 becomes a differential polynomial, and 



L
y
=
0


{\displaystyle Ly=0}

 is the differential equation corresponding to 



L


{\displaystyle L}

.
An operator 



L


{\displaystyle L}

 of order 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is called reducible if it may be represented as the product of two operators 




L

1




{\displaystyle L_{1}}

 and 




L

2




{\displaystyle L_{2}}

, both of order lower than 



n


{\displaystyle n}

. Then one writes 



L
=

L

L

2




{\displaystyle L=L_{1}L_{2}}

, i.e. juxtaposition means the operator product, it is defined by the rule

{\displaystyle Da_{i}=a_{i}D+a_{i}'}

; 




L

1




{\displaystyle L_{1}}

 is called a left factor of 



L


{\displaystyle L}

, 




L

2




{\displaystyle L_{2}}

 a right factor. By default, the coefficient domain of the factors is assumed to be the base field of 



L


{\displaystyle L}

, possibly extended by some algebraic numbers, i.e. 







Q

¯



(
x
)


{\displaystyle {\bar {\mathbb {Q} }}(x)}

 is allowed. If an operator does not allow any right factor it is called irreducible.
For any two operators 




L

1




{\displaystyle L_{1}}

 and 




L

2




{\displaystyle L_{2}}

 the least common left multiple 



L
c
l
m
(

L

1


,

L

2


)


{\displaystyle Lclm(L_{1},L_{2})}

 is the operator of lowest order such that both 




L

1




{\displaystyle L_{1}}

 and 




L

2




{\displaystyle L_{2}}

 divide it from the right. The greatest common right divisior 



G
c
r
d
(

L

1


,

L

2


)


{\displaystyle Gcrd(L_{1},L_{2})}

 is the operator of highest order that divides both 




L

1




{\displaystyle L_{1}}

 and 




L

2




{\displaystyle L_{2}}

 from the right. If an operator may be represented as 



L
c
l
m


{\displaystyle Lclm}

 of irreducible operators it is called completely reducible. By definition, an irreducible operator is called completely reducible.
If an operator is not completely reducible, the 



L
c
l
m


{\displaystyle Lclm}

 of its irreducible right factors is divided out and the same procedure is repeated with the quotient. Due to the lowering of order in each step, this proceeding terminates after a finite number of iterations and the desired decomposition is obtained. Based on these considerations, Loewy [1] obtained the following fundamental result.

The decomposition determined in this theorem is called the Loewy decomposition of

For operators of fixed order the possible Loewy decompositions, differing by the number and the order of factors, may be listed explicitly; some of the factors may contain parameters. Each alternative is called a type of Loewy decomposition. The complete answer for 



n

There remains the question how to obtain a factorization for a given equation or operator. It turns out that for linear ode's finding the factors comes down to determining rational solutions of Riccati equations or linear ode's; both may be determined algorithmically. The two examples below show how the above corollary is applied.

These results show that factorization provides an algorithmic scheme for solving reducible linear ode's. Whenever an equation of order 2 factorizes according to one of the types defined above the elements of a fundamental system are explicitly known, i.e. factorization is equivalent to solving it.
A similar scheme may be set up for linear ode's of any order, although the number of alternatives grows considerably with the order; for order 



n

3


{\displaystyle n=3}

 the answer is given in full detail in.[2]
If an equation is irreducible it may occur that its Galois group is nontrivial, then algebraic solutions may exist.[5] If the Galois group is trivial it may be possible to express the solutions in terms of special function like e.g. Bessel or Legendre functions, see [6] or.[7]
Basic facts from differential algebra[edit]
In order to generalize Loewy's result to linear pde's it is necessary to apply the more general setting of differential algebra. Therefore, a few basic concepts that are required for this purpose are given next.
A field 





F




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}

 is called a differential field if it is equipped with a derivation operator. An operator 



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }

 on a field 





F




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}

 is called a derivation operator if 



δ
(
a
+
b
)
=
δ
(
a
)
+
δ
(
b
)


{\displaystyle \delta (a+b)=\delta (a)+\delta (b)}

 and 



δ
(
a
b
)
=
δ
(
a
)
b
+
a
δ
(
b
)


{\displaystyle \delta (ab)=\delta (a)b+a\delta (b)}

 for all elements 



a
,
b
∈


F




{\displaystyle a,b\in {\mathcal {F}}}

. A field with a single derivation operator is called an ordinary differential field; if there is a finite set containing several commuting derivation operators the field is called a partial differential field.
Here differential operators with derivatives 




∂

x


=


∂

∂
x





{\displaystyle \partial _{x}={\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}}

 and 




∂

y


=


∂

∂
y





{\displaystyle \partial _{y}={\frac {\partial }{\partial y}}}

 with coefficients from some differential field are considered. Its elements have the form 




∑

i

j



r

,
j


(
x
,
y
)

∂

x


i



∂

y


j




{\displaystyle \sum _{i,j}r_{i,j}(x,y)\partial _{x}^{i}\partial _{y}^{j}}

; almost all coefficients 




r

i
,
j




{\displaystyle r_{i,j}}

 are zero. The coefficient field is called the base field. If constructive and algorithmic methods are the main issue it is 





Q


(
x
,
y
)


{\displaystyle {\mathbb {Q} }(x,y)}

. The respective ring of differential operators is denoted by 





D


=


Q


(
x
,
y
)
[

∂

x


,

∂

y


]


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}={\mathbb {Q} }(x,y)[\partial _{x},\partial _{y}]}

 or 





D


=


F


[

∂

x


,

∂

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}={\mathcal {F}}[\partial _{x},\partial _{y}]}

. The ring

 algebraic indeterminates.
Let 



I


{\displaystyle I}

 be a left ideal which is generated by 




l

i


∈


D




{\displaystyle l_{i}\in {\mathcal {D}}}

, 



i
=
1
,
…
,
p


{\displaystyle i=1,\ldots ,p}

. Then one writes 



I
=
⟨

l

1


,
…
,

l

p


⟩


{\displaystyle I=\langle l_{1},\ldots ,l_{p}\rangle }

. Because right ideals are not considered here, sometimes 



I


{\displaystyle I}

 is simply called an ideal.
The relation between left ideals in 





D




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}}

 and systems of linear pde's is established as follows. The elements 




l

i


∈


D




{\displaystyle l_{i}\in {\mathcal {D}}}

 are applied to a single differential indeterminate 



z


{\displaystyle z}

. In this way the ideal 



I
=
⟨

l

1


,

l

2


,
…
⟩


{\displaystyle I=\langle l_{1},l_{2},\ldots \rangle }

 corresponds to the system of pde's 




l

1


z
=
0


{\displaystyle l_{1}z=0}

, 




l

2


z
=
0
,
…


{\displaystyle l_{2}z=0,\ldots }

 for the single function 



z


{\displaystyle z}

.
The generators of an ideal are highly non-unique; its members may be transformed in infinitely many ways by taking linear combinations of them or its derivatives without changing the ideal. Therefore, M. Janet[8] introduced a normal form for systems of linear pde's (see Janet basis).[9] They are the differential analog to Gröbner bases of commutative algebra (which were originally introduced by Bruno Buchberger);[10] therefore they are also sometimes called differential Gröbner basis.
In order to generate a Janet basis, a ranking of derivatives must be defined. It is a total ordering such that for any derivatives

δ

{\displaystyle \delta _{1}}

 and 




δ

In order to apply this result for solving any given differential equation involving the operator 



L


{\displaystyle L}

 the question arises whether its first-order factors may be determined algorithmically. The subsequent corollary provides the answer for factors with coefficients either in the base field or a universal field extension.
Corollary 3 In general, first-order right factors of a linear pde in the base field cannot be determined algorithmically. If the symbol polynomial is separable any factor may be determined. If it has a double root in general it is not possible to determine the right factors in the base field. The existence of factors in a universal field, i.e. absolute irreducibility, may always be decided.
The above theorem may be applied for solving reducible equations in closed form. Because there are only principal divisors involved the answer is similar as for ordinary second-order equations.

Decomposing linear pde's of order higher than 2[edit]
It turns out that operators of higher order have more complicated decompositions and there are more alternatives, many of them in terms of non-principal divisors. The solutions of the corresponding equations get more complex. For equations of order three in the plane a fairly complete answer may be found in.[2] A typical example of a third-order equation that is also of historical interest is due to Blumberg .[14]
Example 7 (Blumberg 1912) In his dissertation Blumberg considered the third order operator

Factorizations and Loewy decompositions turned out to be an extremely useful method for determining solutions of linear differential equations in closed form, both for ordinary and partial equations. It should be possible to generalize these methods to equations of higher order, equations in more variables and system of differential equations.
