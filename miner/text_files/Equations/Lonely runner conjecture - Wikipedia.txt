Example of lonely runner conjecture with 6 runners


In number theory, and especially the study of diophantine approximation, the lonely runner conjecture is a conjecture originally due to J. M. Wills in 1967. Applications of the conjecture are widespread in mathematics; they include view obstruction problems[1] and calculating the chromatic number of distance graphs and circulant graphs.[2] The conjecture was given its picturesque name by L. Goddyn in 1998.[3]

Formulation[edit]



Unsolved problem in mathematics:
Is the lonely runner conjecture true for every number k of runners?
(more unsolved problems in mathematics)



Consider k runners on a circular track of unit length. At t = 0, all runners are at the same position and start to run; the runners' speeds are pairwise distinct. A runner is said to be lonely at time t if they are at a distance of at least 1/k from every other runner at time t. The lonely runner conjecture states that each runner is lonely at some time.
A convenient reformulation of the conjecture is to assume that the runners have integer speeds,[4] not all divisible by the same prime; the runner to be lonely has zero speed. The conjecture then states that for any set D of k − 1 positive integers with greatest common divisor 1,
