In mathematical physics, more specific in the one-dimensional inverse scattering problem, the Marchenko equation, named after Vladimir Marchenko, is derived by computing the Fourier transform of the scattering relation:





K

g
(
r
,

r

)
+

∫

r

K

g

0


{\displaystyle K(r,r^{\prime })+g(r,r^{\prime })+\int _{r}^{\infty }K(r,r^{\prime \prime })g(r^{\prime \prime },r^{\prime })\mathrm {d} r^{\prime \prime }=0}



where





g
(
r
,

r

)



{\displaystyle g(r,r^{\prime })\,}



is a symmetric kernel, so that





g
(
r
,

r

′


)
=
g
(

r

′


,
r
)
,



{\displaystyle g(r,r^{\prime })=g(r^{\prime },r),\,}



which is computed from the scattering data. Solving the Marchenko equation one obtains the kernel of the transformation operator 



K
(
r
,

r

′


)


{\displaystyle K(r,r^{\prime })}

 from which the potential can be read off.
This equation is derived from the Gelfand–Levitan integral equation, using the Povzner–Levitan representation.
