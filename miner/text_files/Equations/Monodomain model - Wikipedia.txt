The monodomain model is a reduction of the bidomain model of the electrical propagation in myocardial tissue. The reduction comes from assuming that the intra- and extracellular domains have equal anisotropy ratios. Although not as physiologically accurate as the bidomain model, it is still adequate in some cases, and has reduced complexity.
Formulation[edit]
The monodomain model can be formulated as follows[1]

,


{\displaystyle {\frac {\lambda }{1+\lambda }}\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf {\Sigma } _{i}\nabla v\right)=\chi \left(C_{m}{\frac {\partial v}{\partial t}}+I_{\text{ion}}\right),}



where 





Σ


i




{\displaystyle \mathbf {\Sigma } _{i}}

 is the intracellular conductivity tensor, 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 is the transmembrane potential, 




I

ion




{\displaystyle I_{\text{ion}}}

 is the transmembrane ionic current per unit area, 




C

m




{\displaystyle C_{m}}

 is the membrane conductivity per unit area, 



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }

 is the intra- to extracellular conductivity ratio, and 



χ


{\displaystyle \chi }

 is the membrane surface area per unit volume (of tissue).
Derivation[edit]
The bidomain model can be written as

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf {\Sigma } _{i}\nabla v\right)+\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf {\Sigma } _{i}\nabla v_{e}\right)&=\chi \left(C_{m}{\frac {\partial v}{\partial t}}+I_{\text{ion}}\right)\\\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf {\Sigma } _{i}\nabla v\right)+\nabla \cdot \left(\left(\mathbf {\Sigma } _{i}+\mathbf {\Sigma } _{e}\right)\nabla v_{e}\right)&=0\end{aligned}}}



Assuming equal anisotropy ratios, i.e. 





Σ


e


=
λ


Σ


i




{\displaystyle \mathbf {\Sigma } _{e}=\lambda \mathbf {\Sigma } _{i}}

, the second equation can be written

{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf {\Sigma } _{i}\nabla v_{e}\right)=-{\frac {1}{1+\lambda }}\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf {\Sigma } _{i}\nabla v\right).}



Inserting this into the first bidomain equation gives
