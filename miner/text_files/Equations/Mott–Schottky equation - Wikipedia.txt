The Mott–Schottky equation relates the capacitance to the applied voltage across a semiconductor-electrolyte junction[1].

 is the permittivity of free space,

{\displaystyle A}

 is the area such that the depletion region volume is

 is the elementary charge,

This theory predicts that a Mott–Schottky plot will be linear. The doping density

d




{\displaystyle N_{d}}

 can be derived from the slope of the plot (provided the area and dielectric constant are known). The flatband potential can be determined as well; absent the temperature term, the plot would cross the

-axis at the flatband potential.
Derivation[edit]
Under an applied potential 



V


{\displaystyle V}

, the width of the depletion region is[2]

{\displaystyle w=({\frac {2\epsilon \epsilon _{0}}{eN_{d}}}(V-V_{fb}))^{\frac {1}{2}}}


Using the abrupt approximation[2], all charge carriers except the ionized dopants have left the depletion region, so the charge density in the depletion region is

{\displaystyle eN_{d}}

, and the total charge of the depletion region, compensated by opposite charge nearby in the electrolyte, is

which is equivalent to the Mott-Schottky equation, save for the temperature term. In fact the temperature term arises from a more careful analysis, which takes statistical mechanics into account by abandoning the abrupt approximation and solving the Poisson–Boltzmann equation for the charge density in the depletion region[2].
