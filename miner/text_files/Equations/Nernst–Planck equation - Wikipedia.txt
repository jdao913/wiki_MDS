The time dependent form of the Nernst–Planck equation is a conservation of mass equation used to describe the motion of a charged chemical species in a fluid medium. It describes the flux of ions under the influence of both an ionic concentration gradient ∇c and an electric field E = −∇φ −∂A/∂t. It extends Fick's law of diffusion for the case where the diffusing particles are also moved with respect to the fluid by electrostatic forces:[1][2]

Where

t is time,
D is the diffusivity of the chemical species,
c is the concentration of the species
z is the valence of ionic species,
e is the elementary charge,
kB is the Boltzmann constant,
T is the temperature,
u is velocity of fluid,




ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }

 is the electric potential,





A



{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }

 is the magnetic vector potential.

If the diffusing particles are themselves charged they are influenced by the electric field. Hence the Nernst–Planck equation is applied in describing the ion-exchange kinetics in soils.[3]
Setting time derivatives to zero, and the fluid velocity to zero (only the ion species moves),

In the static electromagnetic conditions, one obtains the steady state Nernst–Planck equation
