In mathematical analysis, nullclines, sometimes called zero-growth isoclines, are encountered in a system of ordinary differential equations

History[edit]
The definition, though with the name ’directivity curve’, was used in a 1967 article by Endre Simonyi.[1] This article also defined 'directivity vector' as 




w

=

s
i
g
n

(
P
)

i

+

s
i
g
n

(
Q
)

j



{\displaystyle \mathbf {w} =\mathrm {sign} (P)\mathbf {i} +\mathrm {sign} (Q)\mathbf {j} }

, where P and Q are the dx/dt and dy/dt differential equations, and i and j are the x and y direction unit vectors.
Simonyi developed a new stability test method from these new definitions, and with it he studied differential equations. This method, beyond the usual stability examinations, provided semiquantative results.
