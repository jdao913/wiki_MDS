Photon diffusion equation is a second order partial differential equation describing the time behavior of photon fluence rate distribution in a low-absorption high-scattering medium.
Its mathematical form is as follows.

{\displaystyle \nabla (D(r)\cdot \nabla )\Phi ({\vec {r}},t)-v\mu _{a}({\vec {r}})\Phi ({\vec {r}},t)+vS({\vec {r}},t)={\frac {\partial \Phi ({\vec {r}},t)}{\partial t}}}

 where 



Φ


{\displaystyle \Phi }

 is photon fluence rate (W/cm2), 




μ

a




{\displaystyle \mu _{a}}

 is absorption coefficient (cm−1), 



D


{\displaystyle D}

 is diffusion constant, 



v


{\displaystyle v}

 is the speed of light in the medium (m/s), and 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 is an isotropic source term (W/cm3).
Its main difference with diffusion equation in physics is that photon diffusion equation has an absorption term in it.
