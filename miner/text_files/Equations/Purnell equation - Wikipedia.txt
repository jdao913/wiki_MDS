The Purnell equation is an equation used in analytical chemistry to calculate the resolution Rs between two peaks in a chromatogram:[1][2][3]

{\displaystyle R_{s}={\frac {\sqrt {N_{2}}}{4}}\left({\frac {\alpha -1}{\alpha }}\right)\left({\frac {k'_{2}}{1+k'_{2}}}\right)}


where



Rs is the resolution between the two peaks






N2 is the plate number of the second peak






α is the separation factor between the two peaks






k '2 is the retention factor of the second peak.



The higher the resolution, the better the separation.
