Radiodrome - Wikipedia


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

In geometry, a radiodrome is the pursuit curve followed by a point that is pursuing another linearly-moving point. The term is derived from the Greek words "ῥάδιος" (easier) and "δρόμος" (running). The classic (and best-known) form of a radiodrome is known as the "dog curve"; this is the path a dog follows when it swims across a stream with a current after food it has spotted on the other side. Because the dog drifts downwards with the current, it will have to change its heading; it will also have to swim further than if it had computed the optimal heading. This case was described by Pierre Bouguer in 1732.
A radiodrome may alternatively be described as the path a dog follows when chasing a hare, assuming that the hare runs in a straight line at a constant velocity. It is illustrated by the following figure:


The path of a dog chasing a hare running along a vertical straight line at a constant speed. The dog runs towards the momentary position of the hare, and will have to be changing his heading continuously. The speed of the dog is 20% faster than the speed of the hare.


Mathematical analysis[edit]
Introduce a coordinate system with origin at the position of the dog at time zero and with y-axis in the direction the hare is running with the constant speed 




V

t




{\displaystyle V_{t}}

. The position of the hare at time zero is (Ax, Ay) and at time t it is

It is possible to obtain a closed-form analytic expression y=f(x) for the motion of the dog, From (2) and (3) it follows that

(13)



In the case illustrated in the figure above,  Vt ⁄Vd =  1⁄1.2 and the chase starts with the hare at position (Ax, −0.6 Ax) which means that y'(0) = −0.6. From (13) it thus follows that the hare is caught at position (Ax, 1.21688Ax), and consequently that the hare will have run the total distance (1.21688 + 0.6) Ax before being caught. The arclength of the dog's path is (13) multiplied by  Vd ⁄Vt =1.2 .
If Vt ≥ Vd, one has from (11) and (12) that 




lim

x
→

A

x




y
(
x
)
=
∞


{\displaystyle \lim _{x\to A_{x}}y(x)=\infty }

, which means that the hare will never be caught, whenever the chase starts.
