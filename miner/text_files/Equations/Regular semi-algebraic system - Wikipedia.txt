Introduction[edit]
Regular chains and triangular decompositions are fundamental and well-developed tools for describing the complex solutions of polynomial systems. The notion of a regular semi-algebraic system is an adaptation of the concept of a regular chain focusing on solutions of the real analogue: semi-algebraic systems.
Any semi-algebraic system 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 can be decomposed into finitely many regular semi-algebraic systems 




S

1


,
…
,

S

e




{\displaystyle S_{1},\ldots ,S_{e}}

 such that a point (with real coordinates) is a solution of 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 if and only if it is a solution of one of the systems 




S

…

S

e




{\displaystyle S_{1},\ldots ,S_{e}}

.[1]
Formal definition[edit]
Let 



T


{\displaystyle T}

 be a regular chain of 





k


[

x

1


,
…
,

x

n


]


{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }[x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}]}

 for some ordering of the variables 




x

=

x

1


,
…
,

x

n




{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}}

 and a real closed field 





k




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }}

. Let 




u

=

u

1


,
…
,

u

d




{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =u_{1},\ldots ,u_{d}}

 and 




y

=

y

1


,
…
,

y

n
−
d




{\displaystyle \mathbf {y} =y_{1},\ldots ,y_{n-d}}

 designate respectively the variables of 




x



{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }

 that are free and algebraic with respect to 



T


{\displaystyle T}

. Let 



P
⊂


k


[

x

]


{\displaystyle P\subset {\mathbf {k} }[\mathbf {x} ]}

 be finite such that each polynomial in 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 is regular w.r.t.\ the saturated ideal of 



T


{\displaystyle T}

. Define 




P

>


:=
{
p
>
0
∣
p
∈
P
}


{\displaystyle P_{>}:=\{p>0\mid p\in P\}}

. Let 





Q




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {Q}}}

 be a quantifier-free formula of 





k


[

x

]


{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }[\mathbf {x} ]}

 involving only the variables of 




u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }

. We say that 



R
:=
[


Q


,
T
,

P

]


{\displaystyle R:=[{\mathcal {Q}},T,P_{>}]}

 is a regular semi-algebraic system if the following three conditions hold.







Q




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {Q}}}

 defines a non-empty open semi-algebraic set 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 of 






k



d




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }^{d}}

,
the regular system 



[
T
,
P
]


{\displaystyle [T,P]}

 specializes well at every point 



u


{\displaystyle u}

 of 



S


{\displaystyle S}

,
at each point 



u


{\displaystyle u}

 of 



S


{\displaystyle S}

, the specialized system 



[
T
(
u
)
,
P
(
u

)

>


]


{\displaystyle [T(u),P(u)_{>}]}

 has at least one real zero.

The zero set of 



R


{\displaystyle R}

, denoted by 





Z



k



(
R
)


{\displaystyle {Z}_{\mathbf {k} }(R)}

, is defined as the set of points 



(
u
,
y
)
∈



k



d


×



k



n
−
d




{\displaystyle (u,y)\in {\mathbf {k} }^{d}\times {\mathbf {k} }^{n-d}}

 such that 





Q


(
u
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {Q}}(u)}

 is true and 



t
(
u
,
y
)
=
0


{\displaystyle t(u,y)=0}

, 



p
(
u
,
y
)
>
0


{\displaystyle p(u,y)>0}

, for all 



t
∈
T


{\displaystyle t\in T}

and all 



p
∈
P


{\displaystyle p\in P}

. Observe that 





Z



k



(
R
)


{\displaystyle {Z}_{\mathbf {k} }(R)}

 has dimension 



d


{\displaystyle d}

 in the affine space 






k



n




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }^{n}}
