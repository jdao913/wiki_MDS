In stochastic analysis, a rough path is a generalization of the notion of smooth path allowing to construct a robust solution theory for controlled differential equations driven by classically irregular signals, for example a Wiener process. The theory was developed in the 1990s by Terry Lyons.[1][2][3] Several accounts of the theory are available.[4][5][6][7]
Rough path theory is focused on capturing and making precise the interactions between highly oscillatory and non-linear systems. It builds upon the harmonic analysis of L.C. Young, the geometric algebra of K.T. Chen, the Lipschitz function theory of H. Whitney and core ideas of stochastic analysis. The concepts and the uniform estimates have widespread application in pure and applied Mathematics and beyond. It provides a toolbox to recover with relative ease many classical results in stochastic analysis (Wong-Zakai, Stroock-Varadhan support theorem, construction of stochastic flows, etc) without using specific probabilistic properties such as the martingale property or predictability. The theory also extends Ito's theory of SDEs far beyond the semimartingale setting. At the heart of the mathematics is the challenge of describing a continuous but potentially highly oscillatory and multidimensional path

 effectively so as to accurately predict its effect on a nonlinear dynamical system

. The Signature is a homomorphism from the monoid of paths (under concatenation) into the grouplike elements of the free tensor algebra. It provides a graduated summary of the path 



x


{\displaystyle x}

. This noncommutative transform is faithful for paths up to appropriate null modifications. These graduated summaries or features of a path are at the heart of the definition of a rough path; locally they remove the need to look at the fine structure of the path. Taylor's theorem explains how any smooth function can, locally, be expressed as a linear combination of certain special functions (monomials based at that point). Coordinate iterated integrals (terms of the signature) form a more subtle algebra of features that can describe a stream or path in an analogous way; they allow a definition of rough path and form a natural linear "basis" for continuous functions on paths.
Martin Hairer used rough paths to construct a robust solution theory for the KPZ equation.[8] He then proposed a generalization known as the theory of regularity structures [9] for which he was awarded a Fields medal in 2014 .

where the control, the continuous path

 is the sample path of a Wiener process. In this case, the aforementioned controlled differential equation can be interpreted as a stochastic differential equation and integration against "

In fact, rough path theory can go far beyond the scope of Itô and Stratonovich calculus and allows to make sense of differential equations driven by non-semimartingale paths, such as Gaussian processes and Markov processes.[11]
Definition of a rough path[edit]
Rough paths are paths taking values in the truncated free tensor algebra (more precisely: in the free nilpotent group embedded in the free tensor algebra), which this section now briefly recalls. The tensor powers of

 denote the rough path lift of

p

is a

Fractional Brownian motion[edit]
More generally, let

Non-uniqueness of enhancement[edit]

{\displaystyle V_{j}^{i}.}


Note that every stochastic process (even if it is a deterministic path) can have more than one (in fact, uncountably many) possible enhancements.[15] Different enhancements will give rise to different solutions to the controlled differential equations. In particular, it is possible to enhance Brownian motion to a geometric rough path in a way other than the Brownian rough path.[16] This implies that the Stratonovich calculus is not the only theory of stochastic calculus that satisfies the classical product rule

In fact any enhancement of Brownian motion as a geometric rough path will give rise a calculus that satisfies this classical product rule. Itô calculus does not come directly from enhancing Brownian motion as a geometric rough path, but rather as a branched rough path.

There are many examples of Markov processes, Gaussian processes, and other processes that can be enhanced as rough paths.[17]
There are, in particular, many results on the solution to differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion that have been proved using a combination of Malliavin calculus and rough path theory. In fact, it has been proved recently that the solution to controlled differential equation driven by a class of Gaussian processes, which includes fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter

F

 with respect to the uniform topology.
The Universal Limit Theorem guarantees that the Itô map sending the control path 



(
t
,


ε



B

)


{\displaystyle (t,{\sqrt {\varepsilon }}B_{t})}

 to the solution 




X

ε




{\displaystyle X^{\varepsilon }}

 is a continuous map from the 



p


{\displaystyle p}

-variation topology to the 



p


{\displaystyle p}

-variation topology (and hence the uniform topology). Therefore, the Contraction principle in large deviations theory reduces Freidlin–Wentzell's problem to demonstrating the large deviation principle for 



(
t
,


ε



B

t


)


{\displaystyle (t,{\sqrt {\varepsilon }}B_{t})}

 in the 



p


{\displaystyle p}

-variation topology.[20]
This strategy can be applied to not just differential equations driven by the Brownian motion but also to the differential equations driven any stochastic processes which can be enhanced as rough paths, such as fractional Brownian motion.
Stochastic flow[edit]
Once again, let 




B

t




{\displaystyle B_{t}}

 be a 



d


{\displaystyle d}

-dimensional Brownian motion. Assume that the drift term 



b


{\displaystyle b}

 and the volatility term 



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

 has sufficient sufficient regularity so that the stochastic differential equation






d


ϕ

,
t


(

)
=
b
(

ϕ

)

)
)

B

;

s


=
x


{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \phi _{s,t}(x)=b(\phi _{s,t}(x))\,\mathrm {d} t+\sigma {(\phi _{s,t}(x))}\,\mathrm {d} B_{t};X_{s}=x}



has a unique solution in the sense of rough path. A basic question in the theory of stochastic flow is whether the flow map 




ϕ

s
,
t


(
x
)


{\displaystyle \phi _{s,t}(x)}

 exists and satisfy the cocyclic property that for all 



s
≤
u
≤
t


{\displaystyle s\leq u\leq t}

,






ϕ

u
,
t


(

ϕ

s
,
u


(
x
)
)
=

ϕ

s
,
t


(
x
)


{\displaystyle \phi _{u,t}(\phi _{s,u}(x))=\phi _{s,t}(x)}



outside a null set independent of 



s
,
u
,
t


{\displaystyle s,u,t}

.
The Universal Limit Theorem once again reduces this problem to whether the Brownian rough path 





B

s
,
t





{\displaystyle \mathbf {B_{s,t}} }

 exists and satisfies the multiplicative property that for all 



s
≤
u
≤
t


{\displaystyle s\leq u\leq t}

,







B


s
,
u


⊗


B


u
,
t


=


B


s
,
t




{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} _{s,u}\otimes \mathbf {B} _{u,t}=\mathbf {B} _{s,t}}



outside a null set independent of 



s


{\displaystyle s}

, 



u


{\displaystyle u}

 and 



t


{\displaystyle t}

.
In fact, rough path theory gives the existence and uniqueness of 




ϕ

s
,
t


(
x
)


{\displaystyle \phi _{s,t}(x)}

 not only outside a null set independent of 



s


{\displaystyle s}

,



t


{\displaystyle t}

 and 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 but also of the drift 



b


{\displaystyle b}

 and the volatility 



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

.
As in the case of Freidlin–Wentzell theory, this strategy holds not just for differential equations driven by the Brownian motion but to any stochastic processes that can be enhanced as rough paths.

The signature of a path is defined to be

Given the signature of a path, it is possible to reconstruct the unique path that has no tree-like pieces.[25][26]

It is also possible to extend the core results in rough path theory to infinite dimensions, providing that the norm on the tensor algebra satisfies certain admissibility condition.[27]
