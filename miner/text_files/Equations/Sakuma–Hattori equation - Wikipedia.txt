History[edit]
The Sakuma–Hattori equation was first proposed by Fumihiro Sakuma, Akira Ono and Susumu Hattori in 1982.[1] In 1996 a study investigated the usefulness of various forms of the Sakuma–Hattori equation. This study showed the Planckian form to provide the best fit for most applications.[2] This study was done for 10 different forms of the Sakuma–Hattori equation containing not more than three fitting variables. In 2008, BIPM CCT-WG5 recommended its use for radiation thermometry uncertainty budgets below 960 °C.[3]
General form[edit]
The Sakuma–Hattori equation gives the electromagnetic signal from thermal radiation based on an object's temperature. The signal can be electromagnetic flux or signal produced by a detector measuring this radiation. It has been suggested that below the silver point[A], a method using the Sakuma–Hattori equation be used.[1] In its general form it looks like[3]

Planckian form[edit]
Derivation[edit]
The Planckian form is realized by the following substitution:

=

T




{\displaystyle \lambda _{x}=A+{\frac {B}{T}}}



Making this substitution renders the following the Sakuma–Hattori equation in the Planckian form.

Discussion[edit]
The Planckian form is recommended for use in calculating uncertainty budgets for radiation thermometry[3] and infrared thermometry.[5] It is also recommended for use in calibration of radiation thermometers below the silver point.[3]
The Planckian form resembles Planck's Law.

However the Sakuma–Hattori equation becomes very useful when considering low-temperature, wide-band radiation thermometry. To use Planck's Law over a wide spectral band, an integral like the following would have to be considered:

{\displaystyle S(T)=\int _{\lambda _{1}}^{\lambda _{2}}{\frac {c_{1}}{\lambda ^{5}\left[\exp \left({\frac {c_{2}}{\lambda T}}\right)-1\right]}}d\lambda }



This integral yields an incomplete polylogarithm function, which can make its use very cumbersome. The standard numerical treatment expands the incomplete integral in a geometric series of the exponential

provides an approximation if the sum is truncated at some order.
The Sakuma–Hattori equation shown above was found to provide the best curve-fit for interpolation of scales for radiation thermometers among a number of alternatives investigated.[2]
The inverse Sakuma–Hattori function can be used without iterative calculation. This is an addition advantage over integration of Planck's Law.
Other forms[edit]
The 1996 paper investigated 10 different forms. They are listed in the chart below in order of quality of curve-fit to actual radiometric data.[2]

Notes[edit]

^ Silver point, the melting point of silver 962°C [(961.961 ± 0.017)°C[7] ] used as a calibration point in some temperature scales.[8] It is used to calibrate IR thermometers because it is stable and easy to reproduce.
