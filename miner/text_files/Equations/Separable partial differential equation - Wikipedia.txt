A separable partial differential equation (PDE) is one that can be broken into a set of separate equations of lower dimensionality (fewer independent variables) by a method of separation of variables. This generally relies upon the problem having some special form or symmetry. In this way, the PDE can be solved by solving a set of simpler PDEs, or even ordinary differential equations (ODEs) if the problem can be broken down into one-dimensional equations.
The most common form of separation of variables is simple separation of variables in which a solution is obtained by assuming a solution of the form given by a product of functions of each individual coordinate.There is a special form of separation of variables called 



R


{\displaystyle R}

-separation of variables which is accomplished by writing the solution as a particular fixed function of the coordinates multiplied by a product of functions of each individual coordinate. Laplace's equation on 






R



n




{\displaystyle {\mathbb {R} }^{n}}

 is an example of a partial differential equation which admits solutions through 



R


{\displaystyle R}

-separation of variables; in the three-dimensional case this uses 6-sphere coordinates.
(This should not be confused with the case of a separable ODE, which refers to a somewhat different class of problems that can be broken into a pair of integrals; see separation of variables.)
Example[edit]
For example, consider the time-independent Schrödinger equation

{\displaystyle [-\nabla ^{2}+V(\mathbf {x} )]\psi (\mathbf {x} )=E\psi (\mathbf {x} )}



for the function 



ψ
(

x

)


{\displaystyle \psi (\mathbf {x} )}

 (in dimensionless units, for simplicity). (Equivalently, consider the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation.) If the function 



V

{\displaystyle V(\mathbf {x} )}

 in three dimensions is of the form

{\displaystyle V(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=V_{1}(x_{1})+V_{2}(x_{2})+V_{3}(x_{3}),}

, and the final solution can be written as
