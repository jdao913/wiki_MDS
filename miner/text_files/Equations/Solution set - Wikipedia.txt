In mathematics, a solution set is the set of values that satisfy a given set of equations or inequalities.
For example, for a set 



{

f

i


}


{\displaystyle \{f_{i}\}}

 of polynomials over a ring 



R


{\displaystyle R}

, the solution set is the subset of 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 on which the polynomials all vanish (evaluate to 0), formally





{
x
∈
R
:
∀
i
∈
I
,

f

i


(
x
)
=
0
}
.
 


{\displaystyle \{x\in R:\forall i\in I,f_{i}(x)=0\}.\ }



The feasible region of a constrained optimization problem is the solution set of the constraints.

Examples[edit]
1. The solution set of the single equation 



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}

 is the set  {0}.
2. For any non-zero polynomial 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 over the complex numbers in one variable, the solution set is made up of finitely many points.
3. However, for a complex polynomial in more than one variable the solution set has no isolated points.
Remarks[edit]
In algebraic geometry, solution sets are called algebraic sets if there are no inequalities. Over the reals, and with inequalities, there are called semialgebraic sets.
Other meanings[edit]
More generally, the solution set to an arbitrary collection E of relations (Ei) (i varying in some index set I) for a collection of unknowns 





(

x

j


)


j
∈
J




{\displaystyle {(x_{j})}_{j\in J}}

, supposed to take values in respective spaces 





(

X

j


)


j
∈
J




{\displaystyle {(X_{j})}_{j\in J}}

, is the set S of all solutions to the relations E, where a solution 




x

(
k
)




{\displaystyle x^{(k)}}

 is a family of values 





(

x

j


(
k
)


)


j
∈
J


∈

∏

j
∈
J



X

j




{\displaystyle {(x_{j}^{(k)})}_{j\in J}\in \prod _{j\in J}X_{j}}

 such that substituting 





(

x

j


)


j
∈
J




{\displaystyle {(x_{j})}_{j\in J}}

 by 




x

(
k
)




{\displaystyle x^{(k)}}

 in the collection E makes all relations "true".
(Instead of relations depending on unknowns, one should speak more correctly of predicates, the collection E is their logical conjunction, and the solution set is the inverse image of the boolean value true by the associated boolean-valued function.)
The above meaning is a special case of this one, if the set of polynomials fi if interpreted as the set of equations fi(x)=0.
Examples[edit]

The solution set for E = { x+y = 0 } with respect to 



(
x
,
y
)
∈


R


2




{\displaystyle (x,y)\in \mathbb {R} ^{2}}

 is S = { (a,-a) ; a ∈ R } .
The solution set for E = { x+y = 0 } with respect to 



x
∈

R



{\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} }

 is S = { -y } . (Here, y is not "declared" as an unknown, and thus to be seen as a parameter on which the equation, and therefore the solution set, depends.)
The solution set for 



E
=
{


x


≤
4
}


{\displaystyle E=\{{\sqrt {x}}\leq 4\}}

 with respect to 



x
∈

R



{\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {R} }

 is the interval S = [0,2] (since 





x




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x}}}

 is undefined for negative values of x).
The solution set for 



E
=
{
exp
⁡
(
i
x
)
=
1
}


{\displaystyle E=\{\exp(ix)=1\}}

 with respect to 



x
∈

C



{\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {C} }

 is S = 2 π Z (see Euler's identity).
