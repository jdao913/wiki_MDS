In mathematics, a summation equation or discrete integral equation is an equation in which an unknown function appears under a summation sign. The theories of summation equations and integral equations can be unified as integral equations on time scales[1] using time scale calculus. A summation equation compares to a difference equation as an integral equation compares to a differential equation.
The Volterra summation equation is:





x
(
t
)
=
f
(
t
)
+

∑

i

m


n


k
(
t
,
s
,
x
(
s
)
)


{\displaystyle x(t)=f(t)+\sum _{i=m}^{n}k(t,s,x(s))}



where x is the unknown function, and s, a, t are integers, and f, k are known functions.
