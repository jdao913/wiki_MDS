In mathematics, the Thomas–Fermi equation is a second order non-linear ordinary differential equation, named after Llewellyn Thomas and Enrico Fermi[1][2], which describes the semi-classical description of charge density of a high atomic number atom under the Thomas–Fermi model. The equation reads

{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {x}}}y^{3/2}}



subject to the boundary condition





y
(
0
)
=
1.


{\displaystyle y(0)=1.}



If y approaches zero as x becomes large, this equation models the charge distribution of a neutral atom as a function of radius x. Solutions where y becomes zero at finite x model positive ions.[3] For solutions where y becomes large and positive as x becomes large, it can be interpreted as a model of a compressed atom, where the charge is squeezed into a smaller space. In this case the atom ends at the value of x for which dy/dx = y/x.[4][5]

Transformations[edit]
Introducing the transformation

{\displaystyle z=y/x}

 converts the equation to

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{x^{2}}}{\frac {d}{dx}}\left(x^{2}{\frac {dz}{dx}}\right)-z^{3/2}=0}



This equation is similar to Lane–Emden equation with polytropic index

 except the sign difference. The original equation is invariant under the transformation 



x

c

y


{\displaystyle x\rightarrow cx,\ y\rightarrow c^{-3}y}

. Hence, The equation can made to equidimensional by introducing 



y

u


{\displaystyle y=x^{-3}u}

, which transforms the equation to

{\displaystyle x^{2}{\frac {d^{2}u}{dx^{2}}}-6x{\frac {du}{dx}}+12u=u^{3/2}}



which is equidimensional, so the substitution 



u

{\displaystyle u=e^{t}}

 leads to

If

{\displaystyle w(u)={\frac {du}{dt}}}

 then the above equation becomes

But this first order equation has no known solution, so the approach has to be either numerical(difficult to solve) or approximate methods.
Sommerfeld's approximation[edit]
The equation has a particular solution 




y

p


(
x
)


{\displaystyle y_{p}(x)}

, which satisfies the boundary condition that y approaches zero for large x, but not the boundary condition y(0)=1. This is






y

p


(
x
)
=


144

x

3






{\displaystyle y_{p}(x)={\frac {144}{x^{3}}}}



Arnold Sommerfeld used this particular solution and provided an approximate solution which can satisfy the other boundary condition in 1932[6]. If the transformation 



x
=
1

/

t
,
 
w
=
y
t


{\displaystyle x=1/t,\ w=yt}

 is introduced, the equation becomes

,

w
(

,
 
w
(
∞
)
∼
t


{\displaystyle t^{4}{\frac {d^{2}w}{dt^{2}}}=w^{3/2},\quad w(0)=0,\ w(\infty )\sim t}



The particular solution is then 




w

p


(
t
)
=
144

t

4




{\displaystyle w_{p}(t)=144t^{4}}

. So one assumes a solution of the form 



w
=

w

p


(
1
+
α

t

λ


)


{\displaystyle w=w_{p}(1+\alpha t^{\lambda })}

 and if this is substituted in the above equation and the coefficients of 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 are equated, one obtains the value for 



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }

, which is given by the roots of the equation 




λ

2


+
7
λ
−
6
=
0


{\displaystyle \lambda ^{2}+7\lambda -6=0}

. The two roots are 




λ

1


=
0.772
,
 

λ

2


=
−
7.772


{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}=0.772,\ \lambda _{2}=-7.772}

. Since this solution already satifies the second boundary condition, to satisfy the first boundary condition one writes





W

w

λ



)

n


=
[

(

)
]
t


{\displaystyle W=w_{p}(1+\beta t^{\lambda })^{n}=[144t^{3}(1+\beta t^{\lambda })]t}



The first boundary condition will be satisfied if

 as 



t
→
∞


{\displaystyle t\rightarrow \infty }

. This condition is satisfied if 



λ

+

=

,
 
144

β

n


=

{\displaystyle \lambda n+3=0,\ 144\beta ^{n}=1}

 and since 




λ

{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}\lambda _{2}=-6}

, Sommerfeld found the approximation as 



λ

λ

{\displaystyle \lambda =\lambda _{1},\ n=-3/\lambda _{1}=\lambda _{2}/2}

. Therefore, the approximate solution is

{\displaystyle y(x)=y_{p}(x)\{1+[y_{p}(x)]^{\lambda _{1}/3}\}^{\lambda _{2}/2}}



This solution predicts the correct solution accurately for large 



x


{\displaystyle x}

, but fails near the origin.
Solution near origin[edit]
Enrico Fermi[7] provided the solution for 



x
≪

{\displaystyle x\ll 1}

 and later extended by Baker[8]. Hence for

{\displaystyle x\ll 1}

where

Homotopy Analysis Method[edit]

where

{\displaystyle \alpha _{k,n}}

 is calculated using a recurrence relation given by Liao[11].
