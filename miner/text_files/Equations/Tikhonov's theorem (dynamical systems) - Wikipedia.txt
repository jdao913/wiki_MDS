In applied mathematics, Tikhonov's theorem on dynamical systems is a result on stability of solutions of systems of differential equations. It has applications to chemical kinetics.[1][2] The theorem is named after Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov.
Statement[edit]
Consider this system of differential equations:












d

x



d
t






=

f

(

x

,

z

,
t
)
,




μ



d

z



d
t






=

g

(

x

,

z

,
t
)
.






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {d\mathbf {x} }{dt}}&=\mathbf {f} (\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {z} ,t),\\\mu {\frac {d\mathbf {z} }{dt}}&=\mathbf {g} (\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {z} ,t).\end{aligned}}}



Taking the limit as 



μ
→
0


{\displaystyle \mu \to 0}

, this becomes the "degenerate system":












d

x



d
t






=

f

(

x

,

z

,
t
)
,





z




=
φ
(

x

,
t
)
,






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {d\mathbf {x} }{dt}}&=\mathbf {f} (\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {z} ,t),\\\mathbf {z} &=\varphi (\mathbf {x} ,t),\end{aligned}}}



where the second equation is the solution of the algebraic equation






g

(

x

,

z

,
t
)
=
0.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {z} ,t)=0.}



Note that there may be more than one such function 



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }

.
Tikhonov's theorem states that as 



μ
→
0
,


{\displaystyle \mu \to 0,}

 the solution of the system of two differential equations above approaches the solution of the degenerate system if 




z

=
φ
(

x

,
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {z} =\varphi (\mathbf {x} ,t)}

 is a stable root of the "adjoined system"








d

z



d
t



=

g

(

x

,

z

,
t
)
.


{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {z} }{dt}}=\mathbf {g} (\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {z} ,t).}
