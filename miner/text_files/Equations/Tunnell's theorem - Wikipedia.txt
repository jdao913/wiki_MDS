Congruent number problem[edit]
Main article: Congruent number problem
The congruent number problem asks which positive integers can be the area of a right triangle with all three sides rational. Tunnell's theorem relates this to the number of integral solutions of a few fairly simple Diophantine equations.

Tunnell's theorem states that supposing n is a congruent number, if n is odd then 2An = Bn and if n is even then 2Cn = Dn. Conversely, if the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture holds true for elliptic curves of the form

, these equalities are sufficient to conclude that n is a congruent number.
History[edit]
The theorem is named for Jerrold B. Tunnell, a number theorist at Rutgers University, who proved it in 1983.
Importance[edit]
The importance of Tunnell's theorem is that the criterion it gives is testable by a finite calculation. For instance, for a given n, the numbers An,Bn,Cn,Dn can be calculated by exhaustively searching through x,y,z in the range
