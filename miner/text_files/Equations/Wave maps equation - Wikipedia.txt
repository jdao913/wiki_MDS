In mathematical physics, the wave maps equation is a geometric wave equation that solves






D

α



∂

α


u
=
0


{\displaystyle D^{\alpha }\partial _{\alpha }u=0}



where 



D


{\displaystyle D}

 is a connection.[1][2]
It can be considered a natural extension of the wave equation for Riemannian manifolds.[3]
