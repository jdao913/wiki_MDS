In engineering, gc is a unit conversion factor used to convert mass to force or vice versa.[1] It is defined as






g

c


=



m
a

F




{\displaystyle g_{\text{c}}={\frac {ma}{F}}}



In unit systems where force is a derived unit, like in SI units, gc is equal to 1 and is not needed. In unit systems where force is a primary unit, like in English units, gc is not equal to 1, and is required to obtain correct results.[2]
Motivations[edit]
According to Newton's law of motion, the force F is proportional to mass m and acceleration a





F
∝
m
a


{\displaystyle F\propto ma}



or in general





F
=
K
m
a


{\displaystyle F=Kma}



If F = 1 lbf, m = 1 lb, and a = 7000981456000000000♠32.2 ft/s2, then

lbf

=
K

(

lb

⋅
32.2
 


ft


s


2




)



{\displaystyle 1~{\text{lbf}}=K\left(1~{\text{lb}}\cdot 32.2~{\frac {\text{ft}}{{\text{s}}^{2}}}\right)}



Leading to





K

=

lbf

⋅

ft




{\displaystyle K={\frac {1~{\text{lbf}}}{1~{\text{lb}}\cdot 32.2~{\frac {\text{ft}}{{\text{s}}^{2}}}}}=0.03106~{\frac {{\text{lbf}}\cdot {\text{s}}^{2}}{\text{ft}}}}



gc is defined as the reciprocal of the constant K






g

ft


lbf

⋅


s


2







{\displaystyle g_{\text{c}}={\frac {1}{K}}=32.2~{\frac {\text{ft}}{{\text{lbf}}\cdot {\text{s}}^{2}}}}



or equivalently, as






g

c


=



m
a

F




{\displaystyle g_{\text{c}}={\frac {ma}{F}}}



Specific systems of units[edit]


International System
English System
British Customary System


gc = 1 (kg·m)/(N·s2)
gc = 32.2 (lb·ft)/(lbf·s2)
gc = 1 (slug·ft)/(lbf·s2)
