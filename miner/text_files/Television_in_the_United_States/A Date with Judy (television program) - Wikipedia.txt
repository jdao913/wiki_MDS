Premise[edit]
The title character was teenager Judy Foster. The book Television Series of the 1950s: Essential Facts and Quirky Details described Foster as "a very pretty girl who is called 'the cutest date in town'", adding, "Judy has a knack for finding mischief and has a firm belief that her family doesn't understand her."[3] The Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010 described her as "bright, enthusiastic and 'blessed' with a knack for finding trouble."[4] Judy's parents were Melvyn and Dora Foster, and she had a 12-year-old brother, Randolph. Her boyfriend was Oogie Pringle.[3]
The program was derived from the radio show of the same name.[2]
