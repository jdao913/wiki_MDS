AMG Heritage Award recipients and nominees[edit]
The Artists Music Guild produces an awards show every year to acknowledge all forms of artistry. The Guild currently has twenty-five categories in which artists may vie for the prestigious Heritage Award. The AMG's are held on the second weekend of November and were held at the historic Heritage USA, former home of the PTL Club and Jim Bakker and his wife Tammy Faye Bakker.[1]After the loss of the studios the AMG's were then moved to Monroe, NC and sponsored by the city. They are currently taking place at the AG Convention Center in Monroe.[2]
