History[edit]




Logo as HDNet


The network originally launched as HDNet on September 6, 2001, designed as a high definition-exclusive service under the ownership of HDNet, LLC, which then was co-owned by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Philip Garvin, owner of Colorado Studios and Mobile TV Group.[4] Originally, the network aired a variety of programming – much of it being male-oriented, prominently featuring series, sports events and concert performances.[5] In December 2001 and January 2002, HDNet aired exclusive HD coverage of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan with former CNN correspondent Peter Arnett.[6] In February 2002, the network originated eight daily hours of high definition content from the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. This feed was picked up by NBC and aired in 24-hour rotation on the digital signals of NBC's stations.[7]
The channel gradually expanded its carriage to satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network, as well as cable providers Charter Communications, Insight Communications, Mediacom, Suddenlink Communications, Verizon FiOS and AT&T U-verse.[8] On September 4, 2008, Cuban announced that the network reached an agreement with Comcast to carry both HDNet and HDNet Movies in various markets.[9] The provider began to carry HDNet in many major markets on September 30, 2010. In November 2009, DirecTV became the first provider to offer video-on-demand services of HDNet and HDNet Movies.[10]
On January 18, 2012, HDNet, LLC entered into a joint venture with entertainment company/promoter Anschutz Entertainment Group, TV/radio personality/producer Ryan Seacrest and talent agency Creative Artists Agency, in which AEG, CAA and Ryan Seacrest Media would each purchase a share of the network, with Cuban retaining ownership.[11] The network rebranded on July 2, 2012 as AXS TV, a name taken from AEG's ticket sales website AXS.[1][2][12][13] With the purchase and rebranding, the channel gradually shifted focus to include a mix of entertainment news, lifestyle, pop culture and in-concert performance events.[14]
Alongside the rebranding, Dish Network announced that it would expand the channel's distribution to customers who do not subscribe to an HD tier through a downconverted standard definition feed.[15] The provider moved the network to channel 131 in the spring of 2012, increasing its carriage to at least 14 million Dish Network subscribers upon its relaunch as AXS TV.[16][17] Through its relationship with AEG, AXS TV also plans to offer special promotions on concerts to Dish Network users who have subscribed to the channel.[12] On February 14, 2013, CBS Corporation acquired partial ownership in the network, when it traded programming and marketing for a minority stake in AXS TV.[18]
In addition to carriage on cable, satellite and telco providers, AXS TV has been added to streaming media providers including Sling TV in October 2016,[19] DirecTV Now when it debuted in November 2016,[20] and Philo when it was launched in November 2017.[21]
