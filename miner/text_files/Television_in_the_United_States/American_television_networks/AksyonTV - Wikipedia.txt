History[edit]
Originally, local UHF channel 41 was intended to broadcast local programming under the supervision of Nation Broadcasting Corporation. Sometime in 2000, MTV Networks Asia Pacific, operator of MTV (Music Television) brand in Asia wanted to transmit its music channel on terrestrial television in the Philippines. Eventually, MTV Networks Asia Pacific entered into an agreement with Nation Broadcasting Corporation to transmit its localize music channel via its UHF channel and started broadcasting MTV Philippines on January 1, 2001 until the partnership ended on February 15, 2007.
On March 2, 2010 MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., a PLDT subsidiary, Philippines largest telecommunication company, announced the acquisition of ABC Development Corporation, broadcaster of TV5 from the Cojuangco family and Malaysia-based broadcaster Media Prima Berhad.
On October 1, 2010, through its flagship station, it took over the management of Nation Broadcasting Corporation and its radio and television businesses, particularly 92.3 News FM and UHF channel 41. Consequently, UHF channel 41 went on air and began its initial test broadcast of its radio station 92.3 News FM from 12:00 noon to 8:00 p.m. (Philippine Standard Time, UTC+8).
In December 2010, ABC Development Corporation announced plans to launch its own news and sport-related channel. On February 21, 2011, AksyonTV started its commercial broadcast.
On June 1, 2013, several sports programs from IBC 13's defunct blocktimer AKTV were carried over to AksyonTV. This was done by the TV5 Network, Inc. management after the deal expired on May 31, 2013. News and public affairs programs were either moved to a new timeslot or canceled.
Since December 2013, AksyonTV removed its 24-hour broadcasting activities due to cost-cutting measures by the management as well as NTC's rules and regulations for affiliated free-to-air TV stations.
Since the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, AksyonTV is one of the official Olympics broadcasters in the Philippines, together with TV5 and Cignal Digital TV
Since July 21, 2014, AksyonTV ceased producing any independent newscasts including news advisories (e.g. Aksyon Breaking, Aksyon Weather). This was done after TV5 unified all of its newscasts under the Aksyon brand.
Since October 2015, AksyonTV dropped its simulcast of the PBA games after the move of the Filsports Basketball Association from PTV as part of PTV-4 reorganization and the taped airing of the PCBL (Pilipinas Commercial Basketball League) and other PSL (Philippine Super Liga) games on the same network every weeknights and weekends.
In 2016, AksyonTV further improved its sports programming, starting the year with the return of the PBA D-League on Sports5 and being the second home of the UFC (including The Ultimate Fighter) and the PGA tour after its parent network TV5 and cable channel Hyper.
By December 19, 2016, AksyonTV moved from Cignal Channel 1 to Channel 6.
In 2017, AksyonTV reformatted itself to be identical with sister station, TV5, as the network started airing reruns of American series that air or aired on TV5, like, Arrow and Supernatural. It also started airing Movie Max 5 in lieu of live sports programming. This move, almost similar done by its counterpart, GMA News TV was heavily criticized by viewers, putting news programs and coverage on-hold for these programming of the two free-TV news channels.
The network also expanded its broadcast hours till 1:00am on selected days.
Programming[edit]
Main article: List of programs broadcast by AksyonTV
AksyonTV is presented in English and Filipino languages. Programming is distributed equally between news coverage, sports coverage (since June 2013 after the expiration of Mediaquest-IBC 13 blocktime agreement), special coverage, weather and talk shows. AksyonTV's programs comprises a combination of live news reports, documentaries, sports and current affairs programming. Its existing lineup of programming draws upon TV5’s own resources and its news partners. It also airs simulcasts programs of Radyo5 92.3 News FM and news programs of TV5.
After AKTV on IBC 13's ceased operation, all sports programs of AKTV and Sports5 (now ESPN 5) were moved to AksyonTV. The channel also started airing foreign entertainment programs that aired on TV5 from 2017, though it is only considered as filler to the network's programming.
International[edit]
It was announced in early 2011 that it would launch an international channel to support AksyonTV’s local presence. In July 2011, Pilipinas Global Network Ltd., a company owned by PLDT, Inc. and ABC Development Corporation (now TV5 Network Inc.) based in British Virgin Islands will oversee the operation of AksyonTV International. The news channel will be primarily accessible to viewers in the Middle East, North Africa and some parts in Europe and North America.[3]
Controversy[edit]
On March 16, 2011, ABC Development Corporation (TV5) and Nation Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) filed a complaint to local regulator in the Philippines, the National Telecommunications Commission against Sky Cable Corporation, one of ABS-CBN Corporation subsidiaries, broadcaster of ABS-CBN and TV5’s competitor.[4] In its complaint, ABC and NBC criticized SkyCable for its inaction to the request of the latter and subsequently non-inclusion of AksyonTV to its lineup, despite local laws instructing all cable and satellite companies operating in the Philippines to carry all free-to-air networks. Under Memorandum Circular 4-08-88 (or otherwise known as the “Must Carry Rule”), all entities in the cable and satellite businesses are required to include all free-to-air channels on its system regardless of its capabilities. SkyCable on the other hand revoke its compliance to the order due to system capacity and will conform once an additional facility is in place.[5] On April 1, 2011, SkyCable announces the inclusion of AksyonTV on its channel lineup effective May 4, 2011 but made it earlier on April 30, four days from the planned May 4 launch. On July 2011, it was moved from Channel 61 to Channel 59 on SkyCable.
