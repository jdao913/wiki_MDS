Altitude Sports and Entertainment (usually referred to as simply Altitude) is an American regional sports cable and satellite television channel that is owned by Stan Kroenke's Kroenke Sports & Entertainment. The channel, which serves the Rocky Mountain region of the United States (specifically the Denver metropolitan area), features a mix of professional, collegiate and high school sporting events as well as some entertainment-based programming.
Launched on September 4, 2004, Altitude is headquartered in the Denver suburb of Centennial, Colorado. Altitude also operates Altitude 2, a secondary overflow channel that is used in the event of scheduling conflicts with games simultaneously set to air on the main Altitude channel.

History[edit]
Altitude Sports and Entertainment was launched on September 4, 2004.[citation needed] The channel was launched as a team owned competitor to FSN Rocky Mountain (now known as AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain), which became the official broadcaster for both of Kroenke's teams on launch.
Altitude agreed to carry some games from the first season of the Fall Experimental Football League in October and November 2014.[3]
Programming[edit]
The channel holds broadcast rights to the four Denver-based professional sports teams that are owned by Kroenke – the NBA's Denver Nuggets, the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, the Major League Soccer's Colorado Rapids, and the National Lacrosse League's Colorado Mammoth. Altitude features in-depth coverage of the four teams, including holding broadcast rights to the majority of Avalanche, Rapids and Nuggets games. The channel's logo bug changes colors depending on the team being broadcast (powder blue and gold for the Nuggets, burgundy and dark blue for the Avalanche, maroon and black for the Mammoth and burgundy and sky blue for the Rapids).
Altitude also holds television rights to the Major League Lacrosse's Denver Outlaws, Pacific Coast League's Colorado Springs Sky Sox (an affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers) and ECHL's Colorado Eagles. Altitude also broadcasts live college athletics from the American Sports Network and the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference. They also simulcast select college football games from Montana, Montana State, New Mexico State and the Southland Conference. The channel previously broadcast Southeastern Conference, Western Athletic Conference, Big East Conference, and Big 12 Conference games from ESPN Plus.
It also airs entertainment programming including live theatrical productions and concerts, as well as a simulcast of veteran basketball referee Irv Brown's weekdaily radio program. Former Colorado governor Bill Owens hosted a talk show on the network during the final two years of his administration.
Altitude also produces coverage of Los Angeles Rams preseason games, as Kroenke is also the principal owner of the Rams. These games do not air on Altitude (due to Denver being in the Broncos' market). They instead air on local stations in the Rams' market.
