History[edit]




Original logo for Aspire, used from launch to January 3rd, 2017.


As part of its arrangement to acquire a minority interest in NBCUniversal, Comcast Corporation committed to carry several minority-owned channels.[1] The arrangement followed pressure led by Maxine Waters in congressional hearings.[2] In April 2011, Comcast solicited proposals for minority owned networks.[3] In February 2012, Comcast announced distribution arrangements for four networks, including Aspire.[4] The four announced networks and six forthcoming stations are being chosen from among an excess of 100 proposals to begin airing by 2020.
Business plan[edit]
The focus of the network will be "positive, uplifting images of African Americans", according to Johnson. The station intends to deliver films, music and comedy, with a combination of acquired projects and original programming. The programming will include performing arts and shows about faith.[2] The show is intended to provide a forum for African American producers and performers.[5] Johnson is partnering with the Gospel Music Channel. Johnson said the following about the network: "Aspire will be a network that encourages and challenges African-Americans to reach for their dreams," adding that it "will celebrate our heritage, our groundbreaking achievements and the fearless talent that has shaped American culture."
