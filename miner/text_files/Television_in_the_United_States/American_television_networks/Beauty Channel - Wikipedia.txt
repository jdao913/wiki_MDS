The Beauty & Fashion Channel is a satellite TV (and to a lesser extent, cable TV) network in the United States. It is affiliated with Fashion TV.
Dish Network removed this channel from its lineup on July 13, 2007 in a contract dispute with The Media Group, which is this channel's owner.[1] On August 13, 2007 the Beauty & Fashion Channel was removed from DirecTV.
The company is going through a reorganization and hopes to return to DirecTV at a later time. They are "still available on Time Warner Cable in select cities and will be rolling out throughout the country."
