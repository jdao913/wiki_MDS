Premieres[edit]
Illusion not only premiered Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere to American audiences but has been applauded for returning classic Doctor Who to television after well over a decade of absence.[6][7] Illusion will also be premiering the original independent sci-fi vidcast web series, Venus Rises, to television.[8][9]
Website and Related Ventures[edit]
Illusion maintained a science fiction portal site which features broadband video, a community and several related blogs. The site is home to "Transmitter" magazine, an online literary anthology which supports emerging genre writers.[10][11]
The developers behind Illusion originally owned a vodcasting cult movie network called "Clash TV".[12] Clash TV was subsequently repackaged as "Zoe's Drive-In" show on Illusion's lineup.
At the present time, the website appears to have expired as the website now displays a DirectInc page which indicates that the domain is no longer controlled by Illusion TV.
Events[edit]
To date Illusion has been part of two genre events, co-hosting a New York Comic Con afterparty with website Popcultureshock.com and Marvel Comics[13] and joining forces with comic book writer Stan Lee and the Hero Initiative for a charity event during San Diego Comic Con 2007.[14]
Additionally, Illusion co-sponsored the 33rd annual Boston Science Fiction Marathon [15]
