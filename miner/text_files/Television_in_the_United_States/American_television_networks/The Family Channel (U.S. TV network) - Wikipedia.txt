History[edit]




Logo of My Family TV, the former incarnation of "The Family Channel"


In September 2008, ValCom announced that they would purchase the assets of Faith TV, relaunching it as a more broadly-distributed family television network.[4] On December 15, 2008, ValCom deal to purchase Faith TV closed and they relaunched Faith TV as My Family TV.[5] On October 1, 2009, ValCom completed the purchase of the network after making its final $250,000 payment.[6] The network had no connections with the similarly-named Fox Television Stations-owned MyNetworkTV programming service.
On March 22, 2011, ValCom announced that My Family TV would become a joint venture with Luken Communications.[2][3] Many of the programs seen on My Family TV, such as Route 66, Lassie, Highway to Heaven and Daniel Boone also aired on sister network RTV.
In December 2013, Luken Communications rebranded MyFamilyTV as The Family Channel.[7] "The Family Channel" name was formerly used by the former Christian Broadcasting Network-owned cable channel that has since become Freeform in January 2016; outside of some shared public domain programming once aired in the CBN/Family Channel era of Freeform, the two networks have no relation to each other.
