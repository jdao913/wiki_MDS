The Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production is an Annie Award, awarded annually to the best animated television show. In 1998 the award was split into two categories, Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Daytime Television Program and Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Primetime or Late Night Television Program, but was eventually combined into one category again. In 2008, the award received an offshoot category, the Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production for Children. This category will be listed here until it becomes a permanent establishment.[1][2]
