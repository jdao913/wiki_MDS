Asia Street was the umbrella title for the International Channel's nightly three-hour[1] prime-time block of shows geared towards Asian-Americans in the United States. The lineup continued in a different and modified approach on its successor, AZN Television.
Asia Street offered a mix of English-language original programming[2] ranging from sitcoms to sketch comedy programs, as well as anime, dramas, movies and variety shows. One of the better-known shows that came out of that lineup was the in-house sketch variety series Asia Street Comedy, which debuted in 2004.[3]
The block also sponsored the 23rd Annual San Francisco Asian American Film Festival.[4]
From March 28, 2005, Asia Street became the basis for a shift towards the International Channel's rebrand and reprogramming as AZN Television.[5]
