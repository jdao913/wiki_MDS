In 2011, Atlas produced the television movie "Who Killed Chandra Levy?", which aired on TLC and was called "a terrific docudrama" by the New York Post.[5]
Theatrical Documentaries[edit]
In 2007, Atlas Media launched a theatrical documentary division to produce and release feature-length documentaries.[6] The first film from this division, Meat Loaf: In Search of Paradise was an official selection of the Montreal World Film Festival and was released theatrically in 100 North American markets in March 2008. The film is a portrait of the rock performer Meat Loaf, shot during the preparation for and beginning of his 2007 world tour. The film received positive reviews from The New York Times ("amusing"),[7] Variety ("revealing ... leaps off the screen"),[8] and many others. The film was directed by Bruce David Klein. It was released in association with Voom HD Pictures and IFC. The DVD was released by Universal in May 2008.
Atlas Media Corp's second theatrical documentary was Robert Blecker Wants Me Dead, which premiered at the USA Film Festival, and was shown at the Rhode Island International Film Festival as well as the Cork International Film Festival in Ireland. It received a Gold Kahuna Award from the 2009 Honolulu International Film Festival.[9] Its theatrical run began in New York City on February 27, 2009, and the film made its television premiere on MSNBC on April 19, 2009.[10]
In Fall 2016, Atlas released another theatrical documentary Best Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened [1] directed by Lonny Price, Produced by Bruce David Klein, Executive Produced by Scott Rudin, and featuring Stephen Sondheim, Hal Prince, Jason Alexander, Mandy Patinkin and others was an official selection of the New York Film Festival. The film was released in theaters on November 18, 2016 to rave reviews -- Entertainment Weekly called it "A Triumph"[2], the Washington Post "Heart-piercing"[3], Rolling Stone "Mesmerizing"[4] -- and the NY Times said "a sense of wonder animates every frame and leaves you with a misty-eyed glow."[5] The film was included lists of the Best Films of 2016 by the New York Times[6], The Wrap, and Newsweek[7] -- and is currently 94% "Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes.[8]
Digital & Emerging Media[edit]
Atlas Media Corp. launched its Digital & Emerging Media division in 2007.[11] One of their first productions was a series of webisodes for History.com to compliment the History Rocks television special series premiere on The History Channel. Similarly, they produced a series of 2-3 minute pieces for The History Channel's video-on-demand (VOD) component to accompany the 2007 television series American Eats.
The division also produced its first series for Comcast's FEARnet online network in 2007, Rt. 666: America's Scariest Home Haunts. A new webisode was released every day throughout the month of October as part of a month-long Halloween stunt. In October 2008, they created Streets of Fear, also for FEARnet.
Other recent productions from the Digital & Emerging Media Division of Atlas Media Corp. include Expedition: Africa webisodes for History.com, Breaking Down for FUSE TV online, Path to the Podium and The Vote 101, for History.com, How to Beat Death for Discovery.com, and Total Beauty Makeover: Dog Edition, for Lifetime.com. The division also operates Atlas Media Corp.'s own online channel, the MUST SEE BELIEVE on YouTube, which features short videos about amazing people, places and events.[12]
Multiplatform[edit]
In October 2008, Atlas Media Corp. expanded one of its long-running shows, Dr. G: Medical Examiner, into a multi-platform brand, starting with Dr. G's book project How Not to Die: Surprising Lessons on Living Longer, Safer, and Healthier from America's Favorite Medical Examiner, published by Random House's Crown division. The multi-platform effort also included the production of a corresponding one-hour TV Special entitled "How Not to Die" for the Discovery Health network[13] and the development of the companion website HowNottoDie.com.[14]
