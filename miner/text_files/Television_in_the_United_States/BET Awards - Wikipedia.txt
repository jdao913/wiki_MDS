Trophy[edit]
The BET Award Trophy, inspired by three words - aspire, ascend, achieve, was designed by artist/sculptor Carlos "Mare139" Rodriguez.[1] OutKast won the first award trophy during the first ceremony in 2001. In 2007, Society Awards, the New York firm who manufacturers the award, enhanced the quality of the trophy design using plated steel and black crystal.

Nomination process[edit]
There is a voting academy made up of about 500 people from the music industry, media, and bloggers. BET sends out ballots electronically and voters nominate in all the different categories who they think should be award nominees. These are collated by a group called "Yangaroo" that works on other awards shows as well, and they narrow it to the top five nominees, and send that list back out to the academy to vote on the winner.
