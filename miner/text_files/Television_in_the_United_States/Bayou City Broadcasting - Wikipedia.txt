History[edit]
The company's first acquisition of stations occurred in January 2008 when it acquired several television stations in West Texas from Sage Broadcasting.[1] Bayou City briefly exited broadcasting when it sold those stations to Dallas-based London Broadcasting in September 2012.[2]
The company re-entered the broadcasting business in 2015 when it acquired WEVV-TV in Evansville, Indiana. The station had been owned by Communications Corporation of America and was to be operated by Nexstar Broadcasting Group; however, Nexstar was forced to divest the station and Bayou City emerged as the successful buyer, closing the acquisition on January 1, 2015.
On May 27, 2016, Bayou City Broadcasting announced it would purchase two more stations from Nexstar, KADN-TV (former flagship station of ComCorp of America) of Lafayette, Louisiana and its sister station KLAF-LD. Nexstar invested over $1 million in putting together a news team for NBC's newest affiliate (KLAF 46) which began its news production April 1, 2016, 9 months after the station became an NBC affiliate. Nexstar had to sell the stations due in part of its buyout of Media General on January 27, 2016 and by FCC rules could not keep both KLFY-TV, the area's longtime CBS affiliate and the KADN/KLAF duo.
