Black America is an upcoming alternative history television drama that imagines a nation-state formed by African-Americans after the Civil War as reparations for slavery.

Central to the series's premise is the granting of three southern states — Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama — to freed slaves as reparations after the Civil War.[1]
The announcement of the in-development series came in response to HBO's announcement of its own upcoming series Confederate, which posits a different alternate history branching from the Civil War period.[1][2] Both series are set in the modern day.[2]
