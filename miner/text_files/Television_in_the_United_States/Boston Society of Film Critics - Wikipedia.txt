The Boston Society of Film Critics (BSFC) is an organization of film reviewers from Boston, Massachusetts in the United States, based publications.
The BSFC was formed in 1981 to make “Boston’s unique critical perspective heard on a national and international level by awarding commendations to the best of the year’s films and filmmakers and local film theaters and film societies that offer outstanding film programming.”
Every year for the past three decades, the Boston Society of Film Critics give their Boston Society of Film Critics Awards. The 2009 award for best picture and best director went to The Hurt Locker directed by Kathryn Bigelow and also won three other awards (best actor, best cinematography and best film editing). It was the first time in the organization's thirty-year history that one film took home five awards.[1]
Categories of awards:

Best Actor
Best Actress
Best Cast
Best Cinematography
Best Director
Best Editing
Best Film
Best Foreign Language Film
Best New Filmmaker
Best Screenplay [A]
Best Supporting Actor
Best Supporting Actress
Best Use of Music in a Film

Awards are also given for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Foreign Language Film (if the Best Picture is in English), Best Documentary, Best Ensemble Cast, Best Use of Music in Film, and Best New Filmmaker. The New Filmmaker award is named for David Brudnoy, Boston-area radio talk show host and film critic, who was a founding member of the BSFC; He died in 2004.
