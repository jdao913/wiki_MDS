History[edit]
The group was founded on May 24, 2000, after the merger of Viacom and the previous CBS Corporation, as the Viacom Television Stations Group; it was a merger of the Paramount Stations Group with CBS's owned-and-operated stations division. It was rebranded to its current name on January 3, 2006, after Viacom split itself into two publicly traded companies. However, both companies are still controlled by National Amusements.
In 2009 and 2010, three of WCBS managers were named CBS TV Stations executives while continuing to manage at the station. Station manager Peter Dunn was named CBS Television Stations President in 2009. Station creative services director Bruce Erik Brauer was named in June 2010 senior vice president of creative services for the group. WCBS news director David Friend added senior vice president of news in August 2010.[2]
On October 21, 2014, CBS and Weigel Broadcasting announced the launch of a new digital subchannel service called Decades, scheduled to launch on all CBS owned and operated stations in May 2015.[3][1] The channel will be co-owned by CBS and Weigel, with Weigel being responsible for distribution to stations outside CBS Television Stations. It will air programs from the extensive library of CBS Television Distribution, including archival footage from CBS News.[3]
The station group made a couple of content agreements in 2014 and 2015. The stations agreed in December 2014 for its content to be shown on Curb's Taxi TV.[1] In November 2015, the station group agreed to allow Health Media Network air local news reports on its network in doctor’s waiting rooms.[4]
Stations[edit]
Currently many of CBSTS' stations, especially CBS outlets, use a common look in branding. One example is so-called "CBS Mandate" involving most CBS stations calling themselves "CBS [Channel number]" (e.g. WCBS-TV, CBSTS' flagship station on channel 2, brands itself as "CBS 2"). This is the same practice as many other O&O groups across the U.S. Only five CBS-owned stations do not use such a branding convention.
Stations are arranged in alphabetical order by state and city of license.
