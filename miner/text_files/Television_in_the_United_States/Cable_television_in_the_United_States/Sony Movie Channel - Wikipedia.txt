Program blocks and theme weeks[edit]
A program block on the channel is "Killer Mandays", a double feature of horror films on Monday nights.[2] From 000000002017-11-06-0000November 6–12 November 2011 (2011-11-12) the channel aired a week-long salute to Bollywood films.[3]
Availability[edit]
United States[edit]
Sony Movie Channel is available nationally on DirecTV and Dish Network, and regionally on AT&T U-Verse[4] and Verizon FiOS. DirecTV and Dish Network also offer "Sony Movie Channel Everywhere", which allows viewers to watch its movies through its website for no additional cost.[5] The channel is also available through streaming for owners of the Sony Network Media Player.
Sony Movie Channel is also available on Sony's PlayStation Vue platform included with the Elite and Ultra plans.
Canada[edit]
On 31 May 2012, Hollywood Suite announced it would re-brand its high-definition channel Hollywood Festival as a Canadian version of Sony Movie Channel on 4 September 2012 as part of a new licensing arrangement with Sony Pictures.[6] The channel was discontinued on 3 November 2015, as part of the re-formatting of Hollywood Suite's channels to use decade-based formats.[7]
United Kingdom and Ireland[edit]
Main article: Sony Movie Channel (UK)
The channel was made available outside the US for the first time on Sky in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 3 May 2012 (2012-05-03).[8][9] While it is only available in standard-definition, it is accompanied by a one-hour timeshift channel. The channel formerly aired the Animax block every Monday night. As a free-to-air channel, supported by advertising, it is subject to standard UK broadcasting rules, which means that films shown between 5.30 am and 9 pm are often edited to make them suitable for pre-watershed slots. After 9 pm, the rules are more relaxed and films will generally not be censored.
On 10 January 2017, the channel replaced Movie Mix on the Freeview and Virgin Media platforms, becoming free-to-air for the first time.[10] Movie Mix had been broadcasting an identical schedule in its final days prior to the transition.
