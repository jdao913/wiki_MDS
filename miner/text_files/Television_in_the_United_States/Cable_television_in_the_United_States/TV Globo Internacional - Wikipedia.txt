Programmation[edit]
TV Globo Internacional offers more than four thousand hours of entertainment a day, including soap operas, series, miniseries, music festivals, humor programs, documentaries, news and live soccer. The channel signal is generated by Globo in Rio de Janeiro, and transmitted via satellite to the different international distributors. Access to the channel takes place through local cable or satellite operators. They are currently available in more than 130 countries on five continents: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania.
Globo Internacional's programming is similar to that of Rede Globo in Brazil, but because it is an international channel, not all programming generated in Brazil can be displayed (due to international broadcasting rights). Switches are also made in the grid of programs for their subscribers in 115 countries in order to offer more variety. TVGI, in addition to the soap operas and miniseries produced by Rede Globo in Brazil, also broadcasts TV news programs such as Hora Um da Notícia, Bom Dia Brasil, Jornal Hoje, Jornal Nacional and Jornal da Globo, live soccer, besides the 3 telenovelas currently exhibited in Brazil. The chapters will air the day after the transmission in Brazil, due to differences in time zone and editing. The same thing happens in relation to the series. In the case of Vale a Pena Ver de Novo, the telenovela transmitted to a certain region will not necessarily be the same one that will be appearing in Brazil. Serials such as A Diarista, Casseta & Planeta Urgente, Caldeirão do Huck, A Grande Família, Domingão do Faustão and Zorra Total, among others, are also broadcast by TVGI. The subscriber can follow the matches of the Brazilian Championship, Brazil Cup and some state championships. The TV Globo Internacional also broadcasts the Brazilian Carnival, national films, the Jô Program, Spectacular Sports and shows.
He also broadcasts his own productions such as Planeta Brasil EUA, Planeta Brasil Japão, Cá Estamos, Conexões and Aprendendo Japonês, which brings the best of Brazilian communities abroad. In addition it also transmits some programs of the GNT.

Logotypes[edit]
The former logo of Globo Internacional, used from 2008 to 2014, is composed of a blue sphere with a rectangle of rounded corners and unequal ends, which has a spectrum in the colors blue, green, yellow and red. Inside this prismatic rectangle, a small platinum sphere of medium size, which, in fact, is the same logo of the Rede Globo, however, the differential is that the words "TV Globo Internacional" are shown below. From 2012, changed the logo with the words "Globe".
The project is authored by the Austrian designer Hans Donner, creator of several logos of the station since 1976. According to him, the sphere represents the world, and the rectangle, a television screen that displays the world itself. According to him, it was specially designed to honor the arrival of open Brazilian digital television.
