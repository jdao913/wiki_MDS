History[edit]




Former logo as "Cox 7," used from 2010 to 2017.


The roots of YurView go back to the Arizona Sports Programming Network (ASPN). ASPN began broadcasting Arizona sports in the 1980s. It was the official television home of Phoenix Suns until the mid-1990s.
Production and post-production of most of YurView's original programming is produced at Cox Creative Studios.
In March 2017, Cox Communications rebranded its local origination channels under the YurView banner, as part of a nationwide effort by Cox to bring all of their community access channels under a unified brand.[1][2]
Sports programming[edit]
Arizona Rattlers[edit]
In 2012, YurView became the official broadcast partner of the Arizona Rattlers. In 2013 the partnership was renewed through the 2015 Arena Football League season.[3] Rattlers games can be seen by Cox cable television subscribers in Central and Southern Arizona. Games are also available online on Cox7.com. The broadcast team includes Dale Hellestrae, Kevin Ray, Chris Harris and Lindsey Smith.[4]
Grand Canyon Antelopes[edit]
In October 2013, Cox Communications and Grand Canyon University reached an agreement to form a comprehensive partnership that made Cox7 the exclusive carrier of GCU's inaugural Division I men's basketball season.[5] The broadcast team for the men's basketball games included Barry Buete, Rex Chapman and Matt Rosen.[6]
In addition to men's basketball, YurView coverage of GCU sports showcased many of the other Lopes programs. Additional coverage began with a women's volleyball match against Idaho on Nov. 21, women's basketball vs. Chicago State on Jan. 30, and the baseball home opener against Hofstra on Feb. 21.
Prior to the 2014-15 Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball season, an extension of the contract was reached. YurView's coverage of GCU games now extends through the end of the 2015-2016 season which will be the Lopes third in Division I.[7]
Original series[edit]
STEM Journals[edit]
Is an Arizona produced program [8] hosted by Geoff Notkin,[9][10][11] who was previously a host of the Science Channel’s Meteorite Men, focuses on STEM related material with middle school and high school students in mind.[12] STEM Journals highlights recent developments in science, technology, engineering, and math and exploring STEM-related careers. Episodes showcase professionals in STEM fields,[13] and how their professions improve our communities.
Step Outside[edit]
The longest running program currently on YurView, Step Outside is hosted by Arizona landscape architect Pete Curé.[14] The show provides viewers with gardening inspiration through tours of beautiful yards, gardens and landscape projects. Pete Curé also shares his wealth of botanical knowledge in providing tips for plant care and maintenance.
Su Vida[edit]
Su Vida hosted by Vanessa Ramirez and JR Cardenas,[15] celebrates Southwest Hispanic culture, lifestyle, family and food. Su Vida focuses on the Hispanic community of Arizona with culturally impactful stories and information.
