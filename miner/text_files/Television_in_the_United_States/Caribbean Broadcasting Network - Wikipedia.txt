History[edit]
The company (as LKK Group) became involved in Caribbean broadcasting in 2003 when it learned that Puerto Rico lacked a National Public Radio (NPR) station, according to Keith Bass, the company’s President. It quickly established a radio station, WVGN, on the island, which was set up to receive NPR’s national feed; the company eventually sold WVGN to R.J. Watkins & his Virgin Islands Radio Entertainment Detroit, LLC on February 17, 2015, after which the station's call sign was changed to its current call sign. [1]
Present[edit]
Today, the company takes network television feeds from New York and sends them via satellite to receiving sites on the two islands. Syndicated and local programming is also inserted in Hollywood. On the islands themselves, the company maintains relatively small operations with sales and service staffs. Everything else is done from Hollywood.
The company has ambitious plans for its continued growth. There are many other islands in the Caribbean that are under-served by broadcast television, Bass has observed.
It also plans to increase the amount of local programming that it produces. That “local” programming will likely be produced at HCS, explains Bass, where gear, crew and all the other production necessities are readily available. [1]
