The Casting Society of America (CSA), founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1982, is a professional society of about 700 casting directors for film, television and theatre in Australia, Canada, India, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. The society is not to be confused with an industry union. The Teamsters represent some (though not all) casting directors in Hollywood. Members use the post-nominal letters "CSA".
Membership eligibility[edit]
The following requirements must be met in order to join the CSA:

Sponsorship letters from at least two current members of the CSA.
Two years of screen or stage credit as Primary Casting Director.

Casting directors who are also personal managers are not eligible for membership in the CSA.
Artios Awards[edit]
Since October 1985, the Casting Society of America has presented the Artios Awards for excellence in casting. Members are honored in over eighteen different theatrical casting categories in simultaneous events held in New York City and Beverly Hills, California.
