History[edit]
The building was originally an armory which was home to the Ninth Mounted Cavalry, which moved to 14th Street in 1914. Adolph Zukor turned it into a studio for the Famous Players Film Company. Among the films produced there were An American Citizen and That Man from Mexico starring John Barrymore.[1]
In the 1950s Himan Brown bought the studio and gutted it to create two sound stages known as Production Center Studios.[1] In the 1960s and 70s Brown leased the facility to CBS for soap opera productions. It is currently owned by All Mobile Video and Jadeja Studios.[2]
