History[edit]
In 1983, the Chicago Access Corporation (CAC) was established by the City of Chicago as an independent nonprofit tasked with managing the public access channels in Chicago.[3]
Channels[edit]
CAN TV operates five cable television channels in Chicago. They are available on AT&T, Comcast, RCN, and WOW:

CAN TV19: Public Affairs, entertainment, documentary and arts
CAN TV21: Live, call-in Hotline shows, community events and arts coverage
CAN TV27: 24/7 local news and information
CAN TV36: Religious and inspirational programming
CAN TV42: Interactive community bulletin board with blues and jazz from WDCB-FM[4]

Programming[edit]
Any Chicago nonprofit or resident can submit noncommercial content to CAN TV for free, and over 10,000 new, local programs are shown on the network every year.[5] Submitted videos include independent productions and programs made using equipment and facilities provided by CAN TV.
Groups who produce programs using CAN TV's publicly accessible studio and equipment represent a wide range of communities, including seniors,[6] attorneys,[7] and people with disabilities.[8]
Chicago-based nonprofits also host live call-in shows from a dedicated studio at CAN TV. These programs are shown live on cable television in Chicago and online, with topics including youth media training,[9] neighborhood development,[10] and domestic violence.[11]
CAN TV also provides unedited coverage of community events in Chicago, offering live coverage of some events on cable television and online. Past coverage includes public forums,[12] political events like protests and hearings,[13] and arts events.[14]
Programs produced by CAN TV include:

Chicago Newsroom, where journalists and newsmakers analyze the week’s top local stories.
Perspectivas Latinas, which highlights community organizations serving the Latino community in Chicago.
Political Forum, which gives Chicagoans a direct line to their government.[15]

Past community-produced programs on CAN TV include:

Chic-a-go-go [16]
JBTV [17]
Labor Beat
SAIC's ExTV

Independent programming carried on CAN TV includes:

Free Speech TV
Illinois Channel

Training and Equipment Access[edit]
Chicago residents can choose from a wide range of classes at CAN TV to gain the skills needed to make a video. After becoming members, residents then get access to the equipment they trained to use, including digital cameras, edit suites, and a TV studio.[18]
