City Confidential is an American documentary television show, transmitted on the A&E Network, which singled out a community during each episode and investigated a crime that had occurred there. Rather than being a straightforward procedural, the installments began by focusing on the history and spirit of the city chosen. Often, the crime and persons involved highlighted a unique feature of that community.[1] Additionally, the show analyzed not only the crime itself, but also the impact which the crime, ensuing investigation and legal proceedings, had had on the community at large.
Part of City Confidential's success was the wide variety of American cities the show covered.[citation needed] The show premiered in 1998, and featured communities that varied in size and prominence, from the smallest village to the largest urban areas. Examples include medium-sized cities, such as Newberry, South Carolina; Saddle River, New Jersey; Little Rock, Arkansas; and St. Charles, Missouri; and major cities such as Boston, Massachusetts, New Orleans, Louisiana; Miami, Florida; and Los Angeles, California.
The original narrator of City Confidential, Paul Winfield, was involved from the show's premiere in 1998 until his death in 2004. He was replaced by actor Keith David. The show was produced by Jupiter Entertainment. City Confidential aired its last new episode in December 2005.[2]
