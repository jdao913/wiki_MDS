Community Educational Television (CET) is a Trinity Broadcasting Network subsidiary, which owns six TBN-affiliated television stations in Texas and Florida, all on channels allocated for educational broadcasting as mandated by the Federal Communications Commission. CET's general offices along with its flagship station KETH-TV are located in the Alief section of Houston.
All CET stations broadcast generally the same schedule as other TBN stations, with some local programs and educational programming (other than the federally mandated E/I shows) to satisfy the educational license.
