Conaco, LLC is the television production firm owned by entertainer Conan O'Brien. It has produced programs primarily for NBCUniversal, including O'Brien's Late Night and Tonight shows. David Kissinger, former NBCU executive and the son of Henry Kissinger,[3] has been president since 2005.[1]
Conaco's first production credit was the short-lived 2001 reality show Lost. The firm also produced the Andy Richter series Andy Barker, P.I. for six episodes as well as the drama Outlaw, about a former Supreme Court justice (Jimmy Smits) who starts a law firm, which was canceled after a few episodes.[3][4]
O'Brien's departure agreement with NBC following the 2010 Tonight Show conflict allowed Conaco to continue operation until the end of the production season.[5] After that, Conaco switched affiliations to Warner Bros. Television, owned by Time Warner along with O'Brien's new network beginning in November 2010, TBS.[6] Conaco produces O'Brien's late night talk show on TBS.[4] Conaco also produced Eagleheart, a show starring Chris Elliott for TBS' sister network, Adult Swim.[7]
