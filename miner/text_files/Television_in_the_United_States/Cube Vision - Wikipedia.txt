History[edit]
Ice Cube started his movie producing career in 1995 with his then manager Patricia Charbonnet. Together, they produced Friday (1995), Dangerous Ground (1997) and The Players Club (1998). In an interview, when asked, "So when did you decide you wanted to start your own production company...?" Ice Cube responded, "...I just wanted to do it on my own. Put my own team together." Cube, along with new producing partner Matt Alvarez, founded CubeVision (later credited in films as Cube Vision) in 1998.[1] The company's first film would be the 2000s Next Friday, a sequel to Ice Cube's 1995 film Friday. Cube Vision went on to produce All About The Benjamins, Barbershop and Friday After Next, the third film in the Friday film series, in 2002.
In February 2003, Ice Cube signed a deal to star and produce three pictures with Revolution Studios. In an interview, Cube said of the deal, "I believe that a lot of good things are going to happen out of this relationship for both (Revolution and Cube Vision)."[2] The films to come from the Revolution Studios partnership would be April 2005's XXX: State of the Union, which Cube only starred in, and Are We There Yet? in January 2005 and Are We Done Yet? in April 2007, which Cube starred in and produced for Cube Vision.
