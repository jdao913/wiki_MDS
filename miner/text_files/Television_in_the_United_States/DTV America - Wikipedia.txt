History[edit]
In the early 2010s, DTV America secured programming agreements with several networks around the country for quality programming. DTV America owned and/or operated stations are currently or soon to be affiliated with either Antenna TV, Soul of the South TV, Telemundo, estrellaTV, or Doctor TV. Doctor TV is the newest network that offers programming devoted to healthy living, featuring fitness shows, healthy cooking shows, and lifestyle programming. Several of DTV America's stations carry Doctor TV on a digital subchannel, but some on their main channel. MyNetworkTV is also being offered by several DTV America-owned stations as secondary affiliations with programming with another network surrounding MyNet's primetime programming.
To date, DTV America is the largest group of Doctor TV affiliates when that channel was initially launched in 2014, whether it be on the main channel or a digital subchannel on a given station DTV America owns and/or operates.[2]
In December 2014, DTV America gained rights to launch MundoFox (Which is now MundoMax) affiliates in select markets.
In 2015, DTV America and Raycom Sports reached an agreement for three of DTV America-owned or operated Antenna TV/MyNetworkTV dual affiliates to broadcast Atlantic Coast Conference football and men's basketball games under the ACC Network label. They were WCZU-LD/Bowling Green, Kentucky, WYJJ-LD in Jackson, Tennessee, and KPJO-LP in Joplin, Missouri.
