Deerfield Media is a broadcasting company and a shell corporation owned and operated by Stephen P. Mumblow, established on December 1, 2012 by the acquisition of several television stations connected to the Sinclair Broadcast Group. All of its stations are part of duopolies with another Sinclair-owned station, and are operated under local marketing agreements or similar by Sinclair.
As a part of its acquisition of multiple stations from Newport Television in Cincinnati and San Antonio, Sinclair sold WSTR-TV and KMYS (MyNetworkTV and The CW affiliates respectively) to Deerfield, and also gave them an option to purchase WJTC and WPMI at a later date.[1][2] Deerfield Media also acquired KBTV-TV, a Fox affiliate in Beaumont, Texas, from Nexstar Broadcasting Group, whose operations were assumed by Sinclair's KFDM.[3] Through an option exercised by Sinclair, Deerfield also acquired WUTB, a MyNetworkTV affiliate owned by Fox Television Stations. This purchase created a triopoly between Sinclair's Fox affiliate, WBFF, and CW affiliate, WNUV (owned by Cunningham Broadcasting, and also operated under an LMA by Sinclair).[4] Deerfield also reached a deal to acquire the license assets of WHAM-TV, an ABC affiliate in Rochester, New York, also from Newport Television,[5] and to acquire KAME-TV, the MyNetworkTV affiliate in Reno, Nevada, from Ellis Communications on February 1, 2013 as part of Sinclair's purchase of KRXI-TV from Cox Media Group.[6]
