History[edit]
The Dick Clark radio show began syndication in the late 1950s as part of MARS Broadcasting.[1] Dick Clark Productions went public on NASDAQ in 1986.[2] It was taken private in 2002 by an investment group that included Mosaic Media Group and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.[3] Mandalay Entertainment bought CDP's stake in 2004.[4] On June 19, 2007, Dick Clark Productions was sold to Daniel Snyder, Washington Redskins owner and former chairman of Six Flags, for $175 Million.[5] After founder Dick Clark's death on April 18, 2012,[6] Snyder commented that he was proud when he purchased Dick Clark Productions, adding that Clark was "in every sense of the word, a giant." Until 2012, Dick Clark Productions was majority owned by Red Zone Capital Management, a Daniel Snyder-controlled private equity firm, with a 40 percent stake held by Six Flags.[7] The week of June 13, 2012, Red Zone confirmed a possible sale of D.C.P., and that investment bank Raine Group had been tapped by D.C.P. to determine possible suitors for the company.[8] Rumored suitors include CORE Media Group, whose 19 Entertainment produces So You Think You Can Dance with D.C.P., and Ryan Seacrest Productions, whose namesake founder worked with and was mentored by Dick Clark.[7][9]
On September 4, 2012, Red Zone Capital Management reached an agreement to sell Dick Clark Productions to a group partnership headed by Guggenheim Partners, Mandalay Entertainment, and Mosaic Media Investment Partners for approximately $350 million.[10] In December 2012, reports by several baseball insiders indicated that the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball team (also owned by Guggenheim Partners) were in talks with Dick Clark Productions to potentially form a regional sports network for the team once its contract with Fox Sports West concluded.[11] The Dodgers instead partnered with Time Warner Cable to launch Time Warner Cable SportsNet LA.[12] On December 17, 2015, in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company announced that it would spin out its media properties, including Dick Clark Productions, to a group led by its former president Todd Boehly. Variety reported that DCP CEO Allen Shapiro was "likely to be a key player in the spinoff, given his experience in running entertainment firms".[13][14][15] Boehly's stake is represented by Eldridge Industries.[16]
In September 2016, it was reported that the Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group (which owns AMC Theatres and Legendary Entertainment) was in talks to acquire Dick Clark Productions.[17] This was confirmed on November 4, 2016, when Wanda Group announced the purchase for $1 billion.[18][19] On February 20, 2017, Bloomberg reported that the sale was facing regulatory issues in China.[20] On March 10, 2017, an Eldridge Industries spokesperson stated that the sale had been scrapped.[21]
The origins of the name and its styling[edit]
The name and lower-case stylization of Dick Clark Productions dates back to, at latest, 1964, when Dick Clark's public relations manager, Henry Rogers of Rogers & Cowan, suggested naming his production company after himself, so he can be more visible following American Bandstand's move to Hollywood. Later, Clark rented a building on the Sunset Strip, in an area among visible, legendary clubs and landmarks. As Clark recounted in his 1976 book, Rock, Roll and Remember: "I hung up a very modest sign in lowercase print — dick clark productions — and started producing."[22]
