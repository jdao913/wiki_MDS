The Dragon Awards are fan-voted awards that "recognize outstanding achievement in science fiction and fantasy literature, comics, gaming and filmed entertainment". They are given out annually at Dragon Con in Atlanta, Georgia since 2016.[1] The award process consists of two steps: a nomination step where each voter nominates one work of choice in each category, and a voting step where the finalists selected from the nominated works are voted on by each voter. The nominations and votes are collected electronically. Participation is available to everyone, requiring no membership or other fees to vote.[2]
The finalist shortlist for the first Dragon Awards was announced on August 11, 2016,[3] and the winners were announced on September 4.[4][5]
There are currently fifteen categories for the awards.
