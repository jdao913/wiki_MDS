History[edit]
DreamWorks SKG Television was formed in December 1994 as DreamWorks Studios agreed to a $200 million seven-year TV production joint venture with the Capital Cities/ABC.[1] The company was set up to produce series for broadcast networks, cable channels and first run syndication with no first look for the ABC Network, but financial incentives favored ABC.[2] The first show, Champs, was scheduled as a mid-season replacement for the ABC network. Dan McDermott was named division chief executive in June 1995.[3] DWTV's first success was Spin City on ABC.[2] The Walt Disney Company bought Capital Cities/ABC in February 1996.[4]
In 2002, the company's joint venture agreement with ABC ended. This agreement was replaced by a development agreement with NBC with a first look clause, financing for series pickups by the network while taking a financial stake in the show. DreamWorks TV may finance shows sold to other outlets, and NBC paid an annual fee to it.[2]
