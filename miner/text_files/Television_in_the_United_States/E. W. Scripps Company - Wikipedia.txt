History[edit]




This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2014)



The E. W. Scripps Company was incorporated on December 1, 1987,[3] but it traces its history to November 2, 1878, when Edward Willis Scripps published the first issue of the Cleveland Penny Press.
In 1894, E. W. Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League with the addition of Cincinnati Post general manager Milton A. McRae as a partner.[4] On November 3, 1922, it was renamed Scripps-Howard Newspapers, to recognize Roy W. Howard.[5]
On November 23, 1922, the company was placed in trust for E. W. Scripps' children and grandchildren.[6] The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. A number of media companies, including the New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.[7]




The E. W. Scripps Company is headquartered in the Scripps Center in downtown Cincinnati.


In 1990, the company completed a new downtown Cincinnati headquarters, the Scripps Center.[8]
On October 16, 2007, the company announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE: SNI), (HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel (formerly known as Fine Living), Travel Channel and Great American Country). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.
On October 3, 2011, The E. W. Scripps Company announced it was purchasing the television arm of McGraw-Hill for $212 million.[9] This purchase nearly doubled the number of Scripps stations to 19 with a combined reach of 13% of U.S. households. Upon the 2012 death of E. W. Scripps' grandson, Robert Scripps, the Edward W. Scripps Trust was dissolved and its stock divided among the surviving trustees.[7]
The E. W. Scripps Company and Journal Communications announced on July 30, 2014, that the two companies would merge and spin-off their newspaper assets.[10] The deal created a broadcast group under the E.W. Scripps Company name and retaining the Cincinnati headquarters, and a newspaper company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the Journal Media Group name.[11] The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, and it was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015.[12] The merger and spinoff were completed on April 1, 2015.[13][14] Journal Media Group merged with the all-newspaper Gannett Company on April 8, 2016. Gannett had also shed their television and broadcast operations into a spin-off, Tegna, months after the Scripps-Journal merger.
In April 2016, Demand Media announced the sale of the humor/listicle website Cracked.com to E.W. Scripps.[15]In June, it acquired podcast service Stitcher from Deezer[16]
On August 1, 2017, E.W. Scripps announced the purchase of Katz Broadcasting and its three networks plus Bounce which Katz operates, for $292 million, acquiring the other 95% of the company.[17] The purchase was completed on October 2, 2017.[18]
Scripps newspapers[edit]
In 1997, Scripps bought daily Texas newspapers in Corpus Christi, Abilene, Wichita Falls, San Angelo and Plano, plus the paper in Anderson, S.C. from Harte-Hanks Communications, along with 25 non-daily newspapers and San Antonio-based KENS-TV and KENS-AM.[19] The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling.[20]
The company, before the merger with Journal and subsequent spinoff, owned and operated newspapers in 13 American markets:

Ventura County Star (Camarillo, California)
Redding Record Searchlight (Redding, California)
Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida)
Treasure Coast Newspapers:

The Stuart News (Stuart, Florida)
Indian River Press Journal (Vero Beach, Florida)
The St. Lucie News-Tribune (Fort Pierce, Florida)
The Jupiter Courier (weekly; Jupiter, Florida)


Evansville Courier & Press (Evansville, Indiana)

After a proposed joint operating agreement between two other newspapers with distinct histories – Hearst's New York Journal American and John Hay Whitney's New York Herald Tribune – collapsed due to union pressure, all three merged to form the New York World Journal Tribune (all three owners had a stake in the publication as "World Journal Tribune, Inc."). The combined paper did not launch for 140 days due to a newspaper strike triggered by the merger, and ultimately folded the following May. Scripps would maintain ownership of the World-Telegram's annual publication, The World Almanac and Book of Facts until 1993, when that was sold to Primedia.

Syndicates[edit]
Scripps operated United Media (composed of the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association). United Feature Syndicate syndicated many notable comic strips including Peanuts, Garfield, Li'l Abner, Dilbert, Nancy and Marmaduke. NEA, originally established as a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service, later evolved into a general syndicate, and were best known for syndicating Alley Oop, Freckles and His Friends, The Born Loser and Frank and Ernest, in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip.[21] The distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media was outsourced to Universal Uclick in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.[22][23]
Scripps also operated United Press International (United Press from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with Hearst's International News Service) until selling it off in 1982. It also previously owned the Scripps Howard News Service, which shut down in 2013.[24]
Broadcasting[edit]
E. W. Scripps' television division currently owns thirty-three television stations in twenty-four markets; fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, five Azteca América affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, two CBS affiliates, two Fox affiliates, one CW affiliate, and one station independent of any network affiliation. As a result of its merger with Journal, the company has retained Journal's radio station group, along with maintaining the sports play-by-play radio networks for Journal's major broadcasting rights in Wisconsin; the Green Bay Packers Radio Network, and the Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network, in addition to operational control of the Packers Television Network.
Scripps also previously owned the Shop at Home Network from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.
In October 1995, Comcast announced the purchase of E. W. Scripps' cable provider operation.[25]
From 1990 to 1995, Scripps was a partner in the regional sports network SportSouth, along with Turner Broadcasting and Tele-Communications, Inc.; in 1996 the network was sold to News Corporation and became Fox Sports South.
Attempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors QVC and HSN. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations.[26] Jewelry Television eventually acquired Shop at Home, but Scripps still intended to sell its affiliated stations (Jewelry Television discontinued most Shop at Home operations in March 2008). On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its Shop at Home TV stations to New York City-based Multicultural Television for $170 million.[27]
On October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit.[28] This deal was approved by the FTC on October 31[29] and the FCC on November 29.[30] The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.[31]
On February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire Buffalo ABC affiliate WKBW-TV and Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD for $110 million.[32] The sale was approved by the FCC on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV.

The Washington Post seems fine, but recently, in just over a week, three of the biggest players in American newspapers – Gannett, Tribune Company and E. W. Scripps, companies built on print franchises that expanded into television – dumped those properties like yesterday's news in a series of spinoffs.
