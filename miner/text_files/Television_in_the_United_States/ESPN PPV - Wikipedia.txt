ESPN PPV is the banner for pay-per-view events that ESPN broadcasts, including the out-of-market sports packages ESPN GamePlan (College Football, 150 extra games per year) and ESPN Full Court (College Basketball, 30 extra games per week), which merged in to ESPN College Extra in 2015. The network was originally launched in 1999 as ESPN Extra [1] and was renamed ESPN PPV in 2001 [2].
Most ESPN PPV games are also available on select regional sports networks and local broadcast stations as part of the ESPN Plus package and ESPN3.
