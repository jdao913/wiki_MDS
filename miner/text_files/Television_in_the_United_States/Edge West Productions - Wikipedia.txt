Edge West Productions (also known as Edge West) is an American film and television production company founded by Peabody Award winning[5] producer/director/writer, Philip J Day.
The company was formed in 2006 to better facilitate Day's status as a filmmaker. For more than a decade, Day has been an active producing partner with National Geographic Channel, Public Broadcast Service, Discovery, The History Channel, TLC, BBC Television, Channel Four (TV UK), and NHK Japan.[6] Some of the collaborators on projects include writer, producer Aidan Pickering (son of Sir Edward Pickering (journalist)), director of photography Wes Dorman, 1st assistant director Jeremy Gilbreath, visual effects producer Calder Greenwood, writer Aaron Even, production manager Erin Shulsinger, and production designer Clare Brown.
Today, Edge West specializes in making high-end, TV shows with elaborate and dramatic recreations about a wide range of subjects. They have produced multiple films and series since it was founded in 2006.[7] Edge West's first film The Real Roswell has been repeated regularly since it premiered in 2007. Tunnel to a Lost World was voted 'Best Documentary of the Year' by an audience poll in Turkey,[8] the country where the film was made. In 2009 The Skyjacker That Got Away was the best rated program ever on the long-running series 'Undercover History' for National Geographic.[9]
Edge West has produced six TV shows for National Geographic Channel, three of which aired in 2011 and three which aired in 2012 . Edge West was also delighted to have been asked to produce a visual extravaganza for TED (conference). Four camera crews filmed in Long Beach and Palm Springs, at the remarkable 2012 TED (conference). The footage is being used for a special broadcast by NHK (Japan) and for a four-minute sizzle for TED on their web site. Edge West produced a one-hour special for Discovery Channel's Curiosity strand which aired on December 9, 2012.[10]

In 2010 Edge West Productions won a coveted Telly Award for the production of The Skyjacker That Got Away. The story of D. B. Cooper,[11] a man who has eluded the FBI for over thirty years.[12] Four Edge West members of that film, Philip J Day, William Martens, Calder Greenwood and Mark Fenlason have been nominated for an Emmy Award at the 2010 News and Documentary Emmy Awards [13] in the class of Outstanding Individual Achievement: Lighting Direction & Scenic Design. Also in 2010 the company won three other top Telly Awards for Lost Cities of the Amazon, Tunnel to a Lost World and Great Escape: The Final Secrets.[14][not in citation given]
In 2011, Edge West won another two Telly Awards for their shows Vanished From Alcatraz and Born to Rage?.[15][not in citation given] Again in 2012, Edge West won two Silver Telly Awards and a Bronze Telly Award for their show "Crime Lords of Tokyo"[16][not in citation given]
Owner of Edge West Productions, Philip J Day, is a multi-award-winning producer and director. His series on Lyndon B. Johnson's secret and illegal White House tape recordings began with "Hello Mr President"(1997). The long running series "The White House Tapes: Johnson Tapes" went on to win multiple awards including an Emmy Award, three EMMY nominations and a Peabody Award.[17]
Festivals[edit]
In December 2011, Edge West was contacted by the Museo Civico di Rovereto requesting that the company submit some of its films for the "International Festival of Archaeological Film". Three of Edge West's films, "Lost Cities of the Amazon", "Tunnel to a Lost World", and "Nasca Lines: The Buried Secrets" were shown at the festival in October 2012 in Rovereto,Italy. All three films were voted into the top 20 films of the festival with "Lost Cities of the Amazon" at #5, "Tunnel to a Lost World" at #6, and "Nasca Lines: The Buried Secrets" at #19.
In October 2012, Edge West was again contacted to show some of its films. The company has currently submitted the films "Lost Cities of the Amazon", "Tunnel to a Lost World", and "Nasca Lines: The Buried Secrets" to "The Archaeology Channel International Film and Video Festival". These three films will be shown at the festival held in Eugene, Oregon between May 7–13, 2013.
Charities[edit]
The Employees of Edge West often bring in aspiring filmmakers to teach them "the ropes" of the entertainment industry. Phil's daughter, Kaya, was one of their many students, who at the age of 16 obtained her first production credit for the film Nasca Lines: The Buried Secrets. They have continued to train many students through their internship program in an effort to expose them to the creative world of film making.
Phil often races triathlons under the banner of Edge West to raise money for children's charities like the Children's Hospital Los Angeles.
Filmography[edit]
Since its inception in 2006, Edge West Productions has produced fifteen documentaries for National Geographic Channel and one for PBS and were honored to produce a four-minute sizzle for TED 2012. Its current production (title to be released at a later date) will air on the Discovery Channel on December 9, 2012.
