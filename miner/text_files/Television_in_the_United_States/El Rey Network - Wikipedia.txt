Background[edit]
El Rey Network is Univision Communications' second cable network to be offered in the English language after Fusion. As with Fusion (which was a joint venture with ABC News until The Walt Disney Company sold its share in 2016), El Rey is also a joint venture between Univision and other parties - in this case, broadcaster Cox Communications and film director Robert Rodriguez, with the entity working under the name of "El Netwarko Groupo".
Broadcast[edit]
The network airs on the digital basic service in some of Comcast's systems.[3] Comcast had announced that the network was expected to debut by January 2014.[4] In August 2012, the network announced that its CEO is Antoinette Alfonso Zel.[5] In May 2013, Univision announced that it was investing in El Rey.[6][7]
Upon launch in the week of December 15, 2013,[8] El Rey was offered by cable companies Time Warner Cable and Comcast,[9][10] with Bright House Networks offering soon later in January 2014,[11] and Cox Communications by February 2014.[8]
The first satellite service to host El Rey was DirecTV in January 2014,[12] the second, Dish Network, came a year later in January 2015.[13] In February 2015, El Rey was made available through cable company Suddenlink Communications in select markets.[14] In July 2016, it was added to the Verizon Fios lineup. However, it was removed, along with all other Univision networks, in October 2017 due to carriage disputes.
Original programming[edit]
In November 2013, it was announced that the production of From Dusk till Dawn: The Series had already begun.[15] The Director's Chair with Robert Rodriguez premiered in May 2014 with John Carpenter as his first spotlighted director. On July 10, it was announced that Guillermo Del Toro and Quentin Tarantino would be the next two directors spotlighted in July and August 2014, respectively. Matador, from Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, premiered in July 2014. Lucha libre program Lucha Underground, featuring wrestlers from Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) and produced by Mark Burnett, premiered on October 29, 2014.[16][17]
