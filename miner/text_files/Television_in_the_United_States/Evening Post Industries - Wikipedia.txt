Evening Post Industries is a privately held American media company, based in Charleston, South Carolina, United States.
On August 6, 2013, the company changed its name to Evening Post Industries (from Evening Post Publishing Company). In a press release, CEO John Barnwell stated, “The name change better reflects our existing diversified holdings and ongoing acquisition strategy in beyond media, while keeping the legacy value of Evening Post." [1]
In addition to The Post and Courier of Charleston, the South's oldest daily newspaper, the company owns six other newspapers in South Carolina, including the Aiken Standard. The company also owned the Buenos Aires Herald in Argentina, Latin America's oldest English language newspaper, until 2007.[2][3]
Other holdings include Cordillera Communications' 13 television stations, White Oak Forestry Company, and a marketing agency, Clear Night Group.
