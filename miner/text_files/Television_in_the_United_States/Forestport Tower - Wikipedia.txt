Forestport Tower was a guyed, steel tower, insulated from the earth, so that the entire structure was used to radiate electromagnetic waves in the VLF (Very Low Frequency; 3 kHz to 30 kHz) and LF (Low Frequency; 30 kHz to 300 kHz) bands. The tower was located near Forestport in Oneida County, New York, United States. Forestport Tower was built in 1950. It had a height of 1218 ft (371.25 metres). Forestport Tower was used for experimental transmissions in the LF and VLF-range; some of these included the first tests of the LORAN-C and Omega Navigation System. On April 21, 1998 it was demolished by explosives.
