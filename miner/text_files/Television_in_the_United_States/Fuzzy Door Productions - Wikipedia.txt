Fuzzy Door Productions, Inc. is the production company of television producer Seth MacFarlane. The company's productions include the animated series Family Guy, American Dad!, and the Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, as well as the live-action sitcom The Winner and the science documentary series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.
The name of the company comes from the leopard-printed fake fur-covered door to the house MacFarlane lived in when he was attending Rhode Island School of Design as an undergraduate in animation. The house itself also went by the nickname The Fuzzy Door during MacFarlane's residence and was the location of many "Fuzzy Door" parties. The company was established in 1998. The Fuzzy Door Productions logo was designed by Cory Brookes, a friend and housemate of Seth's at the Fuzzy Door residence.
