History[edit]
GMA News TV was created as a replacement for "Q", a network which primarily featured imported dramas and lifestyle-oriented programming aimed towards women. GMA News TV was unveiled on February 7, 2011, and Q was discontinued on February 20, 2011 in preparation for the launch of the new service, which occurred on February 28, 2011.[1][2][3][4]
Programming[edit]
Main article: List of programs broadcast by GMA News TV
Most of GMA News TV's programming consists of news, public affairs and sports programming produced by GMA News and Public Affairs including entertainment, lifestyle, cooking shows, talk shows, infotainment, local and foreign drama, comedy and reality series, travel, infomercials and local and foreign movie blocks and additional programming produced by GMA Entertainment TV carried over from Q.
As part of its agreement to operate DZOE-TV as a carrier of GMA News TV (dating back to the establishment of Q), it also airs religious programming produced by ZOE during off-peak hours.
International[edit]
Later in 2011, GMA would also launch a 24-hour international feed of GMA News TV, as a compliment to its two other international channels (GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV). It began to be offered as a preview channel in Australia on FetchTV, IPS/AccessTV in Japan, GUdTV in Guam and on OSN, with an official launch planned for the third quarter of 2011.[5][6][7][8]
GMA News TV International was officially launched on UBI World TV on December 1, 2011.[9] In May 2012, Canadian IPTV provider MTS TV added GMA News TV International, becoming its first Canadian carrier. In November 2012, Optik TV added the channel to their lineup. Additionally, GMA News TV international is now also available in Singtel TV Pay TV Customers in Singapore Channel 690 in SD, on ABNXcess Pay TV Customers in Malaysia Channel 731 in SD and also on Astro
Unlike its domestic counterpart, programs on GMA News TV International are air tape-delayed, except for selected special events such as live coverage of Day 1 of Eleksyon 2013.
