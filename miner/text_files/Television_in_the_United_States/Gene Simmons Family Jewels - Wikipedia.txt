Gene Simmons Family Jewels is an American reality television series that premiered on A&E on August 7, 2006. The show follows the life of Kiss bassist and vocalist Gene Simmons, his longtime partner and wife Shannon Tweed, and their two children, Nick and Sophie. Although it is presented as a reality series, it has been noted that some events shown on the show did not actually occur. One of these events was depicted in the finale of Season 3, where the viewer is led to believe that Gene purchased the Australian Football team Carlton Football Club, while in reality there is no record of the team being sold to him. In addition to this, the episode shows Gene convincing Brendan Fevola to join Carlton Football Club, while in reality Fevola had been playing for Carlton since he was drafted in 1998.[1] Other events include casting biker extras, as well as a bit actor in the show.[2]
Prior to the third season, the series was the second highest rated series on A&E, behind Dog the Bounty Hunter.[3] In Australia, the series is shown on The Biography Channel every Wednesday at 8:30 pm on Foxtel and Austar. It is also shown on the free to air channel 7mate. The first three seasons were played back to back ending on April 1, 2009. Seasons 1-5 have been released on DVD. Season 6 premiered on June 14, 2011 on A&E[4] with the episode "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do." In addition to relationship troubles between Simmons and Tweed, that culminated in the two marrying, the season shows Simmons' March 2011 visit to Israel. After the show’s most successful season ever, Gene Simmons Family Jewels returned for its seventh season on Monday, May 28, 2012, with a special one-hour premiere. In August 2012, A&E announced the seventh season would be the last, and Simmons added that he would not shop the series to other networks and, instead, will focus on the Kiss tour and other business commitments.[5]
