History[edit]
The Gracie Awards ceremony is presented by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation (AWM), since 1975. The awards are named after radio and television star Gracie Allen. Gracie was a successful comedian, entertainer, entrepreneur and activist. As half of the Burns and Allen act, with husband George Burns, one of the most prominent comedy teams in American history, Gracie has been a role model for women in media and entertainment.
The Gracie Awards are held on two days, a gala and a luncheon. The Gracie Awards Gala is a black tie evening affair and awards individuals in the national and mainstream arena. The Gracie Awards Gala has been regularly held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles, California. The Gracie Awards Luncheon, a more casual affair, honors local, public, online and student works and has been held in New York.[1]
