Origin and development[edit]
Ron Daise's book Reminiscences of Sea Island Heritage was published in 1987. He and his New York-born wife, Natalie Daise (née Eldridge), followed by creating and touring with a multimedia show, Sea Island Montage, based on the book as well as stories from oral histories of elderly St. Helena Island residents.[4][5] After one of their performances, the Daises met with an executive producer from Nickelodeon.[6] Creator Maria Perez-Brown had planned on building a multicultural program featuring a "magical island" and was inspired by the Daises to use the Sea Islands and elements of Gullah culture.[7][8][9] Part of Nickelodeon's initiative to broaden its preschool programming, Gullah Gullah Island was the first show of its kind to star an African-American family set in an indigenously black community.[6][10] The show's originality caused some upfront concerns. "We were apprehensive about naming it 'Gullah Gullah Island'. We wanted to make sure the portrayal was positive and didn't in any way poke fun at the culture or the community," Ron Daise said of creating a show based on an existing culture.[11]
Format and production[edit]
Gullah Gullah Island is a sing-a-long half-hour live-action show.[2] The format was part of a 'flexible-thinking' initiative that taught children to make good choices rather than using a rote memorization.[8][12]
The series revolves around a family headed by Ron and Natalie Daise, playing fictionalized versions of themselves, set on the fictional "Gullah Gullah Island". Additional cast featured the Daise's actual children Simeon and Sara among others, including a full-body puppet frog, Binyah Binyah ('Binyah' is the Gullah word for 'island native'.)[13] The show was taped and recorded at Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando at Universal Studios Florida, with the show Clarissa Explains It All shot on the same set (interior and exterior).[6][14][15] Outdoor shots featured Beaufort, South Carolina and Fripp Island.[11][16] Charleston, SC was featured in one episode when the family took a trip to the City Market.[17][18]
Episodes are presented with a unified plot and not separate segments, featuring singing, dancing, learning and encouraging children to think about things like taking care of yourself, animals, telling the truth, social skills, and problem solving.[12][19] The show also highlights the culture and language of Gullah, descendants of former slaves who live on the Sea Islands off South Carolina and Georgia.[18]
Reception[edit]
Critical reception[edit]
Critical reception of the show was consistently positive; both as a children's show and as groundbreaker for African American programming, it was praised for "vividly colored sets, infectious sing-alongs, unique character accents and quirky humor that defined the show and introduced millions of children to an overlooked but centuries-old branch of African American culture."[20] It was described as "a combination summer camp, cheerleading session and music video."[21] The issues, especially with the first season, had to do with show's depiction being unrealistic. "The songs were lively and catchy, the kids were cute and the general theme was unlike other kids' programming," Jenifer Managan of Chicago Tribune wrote. However;

...it stars "perfect" parents, Ron and Natalie Daise, who with their three children (who never fight), neighbors and friends seek to entertain and socially educate kids through a sing-song series. While the show encourages active participation from at-home viewers, the dictionary responses and incomparable energy from the Daises make normal parents look like misfits. Perhaps as the show seasons, the lip-syncing will improve and the characters won't be so picture-perfect.[11][12]

In 1996, TV Guide named the show one of "10 best children's shows".[5] During its original broadcast, it was Nickelodeon's highest-rating preschool show averaging more 750,000 viewers per episode.[10][14][19]

Binyah Binyah![edit]
In 1997, five episodes of a Gullah Gullah Island miniseries titled Binyah Binyah! were produced at the now-defunct Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida, and aired from February 2 to February 6, 1998.[31] A separate theme song written by Sean Altman[32] was given to these episodes. The miniseries also featured several new puppet characters in addition to the original cast, and focused on polliwog Binyah Binyah journeying to locations outside of Gullah Gullah. Ron and Natalie Daise were a part of the cast as well.[33] It was never broadcast again after its initial airing of episodes, nor was it released to home video. A promo advertising the series' debut is the only known footage. Although it is believed that all five episodes are lost, most recently, it is announced on Lost Media Wiki that Episodes 4 and 5 are found, in the form of a collector's copy.

There will be familiar songs and stories and children will be encouraged to participate. But Ron doesn't want to say too much about the theme of the low-tech touring show. "It's to encourage the children to use their imaginations to pretend," is all he will say. "I'd like it to be a surprise for the audience." A big difference between the television show and the touring show is there's a lot less dialogue without the presence of the show's close-knit "family" of three children and relatives and friends. The Daises' own children, Simeon, 4, and Sara, 7, both act on the television show. The touring show started as a 30-minute live gig at bookstores and malls. It was called "Nick Jr. Story and Song Play Along." The crowds were so large that in January, Nickelodeon launched an 1-1/2-hour show for larger venues. Going on the road was old hat for Ron and Natalie, who, before "Gullah Gullah Island," traveled the country for a decade performing "Sea Island Montage," a two-person show featuring the songs and stories of the Gullah people.
