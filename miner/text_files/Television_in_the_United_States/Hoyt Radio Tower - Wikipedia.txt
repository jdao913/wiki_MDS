Hoyt Radio Tower.


Hoyt Radio Tower is the tallest man-made structure in Colorado and one of the tallest buildings in the world. Hoyt Radio Tower is a 608.1-metre (1,995 ft) tall guyed mast near Hoyt, Colorado (50 km due east of Denver).
It was built in 2003 by Acme Towers, LLC and is currently owned and operated by the Denver Radio Tower Company for FM-broadcasting as KJHM and KFCO, As well as emergency services communications site. Unlike most other short towers, which are painted red and white in seven alternating bands for aircraft warning, but like most very tall towers, the Hoyt Radio Tower is unpainted and uses strobe lights for aircraft warning.
The Hoyt Radio Tower is not only extremely tall; its basement is also situated 1,509 metres (4,951 ft) above sea level, so it is not only one of the world's tallest structure, but also one of the few supertall structures in the world, whose basement is situated in an altitude of over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft).
