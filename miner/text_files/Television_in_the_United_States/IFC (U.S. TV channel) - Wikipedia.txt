Original focus on independent films[edit]




This section needs expansion with: information on the history of the Independent Film Channel. You can help by adding to it. (May 2010)



The channel debuted on September 1, 1994, under the ownership of Rainbow Media, a subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation; IFC originated as a spin-off of then-sibling channel Bravo, which focused at that time on a wider variety of programming than IFC, including arts-related programming. The Independent Film Channel originally operated as a commercial-free service, with films being shown without interruption.
In 2005, IFC opened the IFC Center, a movie theater for independent film in New York City.[5] In 2008, IFC launched its Media Lab Studios, a section of its website on which users can enter IFC-sponsored film contests, and can view others’ films. Numerous contests are run simultaneously, each with a different focus and guidelines for entries, and are presented by IFC and another sponsor. Recent contest sponsors include Scion, Absolut Vodka, and Red Bull. In 2008, Rainbow Media acquired competing independent film service Sundance Channel from Robert Redford and Showtime Networks.[6]
Format change[edit]




Logo from 2010 to 2014


By the mid-2000s, IFC began shifting away from running only independent films; original and acquired television series began to be incorporated within the channel's programming inventory. In March 2010, IFC unveiled a newly redesigned logo and a new slogan – Always On. Slightly Off – which reflects IFC's shift from merely airing independent films to also airing cult television series and specials with an indie flavor and sensibility.[7] Around this time, IFC became an advertiser-supported service and started commercial advertisements between programs. Theatrically released feature films, many of whom AMC holds television rights to, also became part of IFC's schedule.
On December 8, 2010, IFC began airing commercials within its programming, a move that sparked controversy among its viewers.[8][9] Along with this, IFC began to censor its programming. Most notably, The Whitest Kids U'Know had profanity bleeped and nudity blurred. In addition, all sex scenes from movies that featured nudity were now edited out. Despite continuing to air advertisements during its programming, IFC largely reversed its censorship practices and started to air R-rated movies and TV-MA rated series uncensored. The channel would publicly trumpet this fact in 2012 by releasing ads featuring showings of back-to-back blocks of movies like the Friday the 13th film series, highlighting the nudity and gore.[10] However, episodes of some programs rated TV-14 are still censored.[11]
On July 1, 2011, Rainbow Media was spun off from Cablevision into a separate company, which was renamed AMC Networks.[12] The name "IFC" is now an orphan initialism. On January 9, 2014, network general manager Jennifer Caserta announced: "The name 'Independent Film Channel' has been legally retired...starting today, IFC is legally IFC."[13] Beginning in May, the IFC logo, which was used since 2010 was rendered in 3-D.[14]

International version[edit]
Canada[edit]
Main article: IFC (Canadian TV channel)
The Canadian version of the Independent Film Channel launched on August 15, 2001 under the ownership of Salter Street Films, under a brand licensing agreement with Rainbow Media. Alliance Atlantis acquired the channel in December 2001, through its purchase of Salter Street Films.[35] On January 18, 2008,[36] a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media,[37] acquired control of IFC through its purchase of Alliance Atlantis' broadcasting assets, which were placed in a trust in August 2007.[38]
On October 27, 2010, IFC Canada's ownership changed again through Shaw Communications' acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs' interest in CW Media.[39][40] As with its U.S. namesake, the channel originally focused almost exclusively on smaller independent films. However, IFC Canada has broadened its programming focus to include more mainstream films from large production studios as the U.S. channel has done. It has also de-emphasized the use of the full Independent Film Channel name, instead using the IFC acronym, possibly due to the decrease in the number of independent films on its schedule.
As of 2014, none of IFC's original programming has aired on this channel. Rival broadcaster Bell Media currently owns exclusive rights to their shows and has aired them on their various networks, including The Movie Network and MuchMusic.[41]
