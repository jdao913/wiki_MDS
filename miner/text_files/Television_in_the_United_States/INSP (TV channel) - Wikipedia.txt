INSP (formerly The Inspiration Network; the initialism is sounded out letter-by-letter) is an American digital cable and satellite television channel that features family entertainment programming. INSP is headquartered in Indian Land, South Carolina, near Charlotte, North Carolina. It is wholly owned by Inspiration Ministries. Between 1991 and 2010, INSP was a non-profit ministry focused network. In October 2010, it was re-branded and launched as a commercial-supported, family-entertainment network with Nielsen C3 ratings status. As of February 2015, approximately 80,584,000 of American households (69.2% of households with television) receive INSP.[1]

History[edit]
See also: PTL Satellite Network
INSP was founded in 1978 as the PTL Television Network, a religious television network founded by Christian televangelists Jim Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye Bakker. The network was the flagship channel for their daily Christian variety program, The PTL Club. The network later became known as the PTL Satellite Network and finally PTL – The Inspirational Network.
In 1990, after Jim Bakker resigned, the PTL Television network filed for bankruptcy. Morris Cerullo World Evangelism eventually purchased the network from the United States Bankruptcy Court in Columbia, South Carolina. Morris’ son, David, was later named CEO of the network. David Cerullo remains as its CEO, with wife Barbara and son Ben working in various leadership roles at the network.[2]
In October 2010, the network announced a major re-branding with an added emphasis on family programming. Along with the re-branding came a new logo, tagline and name change from Inspiration to INSP.
Programming[edit]
INSP features a mixture of family value-based entertainment content and religious programming representing diverse religious denominations.
A part of INSP’s re-branding in 2010 included the addition of reruns of popular family-oriented secular shows, specials and movies. The Waltons, Wind at My Back, Our House, and Highway to Heaven were added to INSP’s prime time slots. INSP continues to add more family-oriented programs and films to its lineup, and its roster of series has included Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, The Waltons, Daniel Boone, Bonanza, Matlock, The Big Valley, Little House on the Prairie, Walker, Texas Ranger, The High Chaparral, and The Virginian. In late September 2013, INSP added newer programming to its lineup, including JAG, Christy, Robin Hood, and Lark Rise to Candleford, but the latter two were removed from the schedule a year later.[3] Ministry programming, once a large majority of the network's schedule, has gradually been reduced since 2010; it is now only seen between 4:00AM and 7:00AM weekdays and during early morning hours on Saturday and Sunday, with family-oriented secular series and films airing other times.
Original programming[edit]
In its early years, INSP produced numerous original specials, concerts, and inspirational[4][5] entertainment programs. INSP also produced and aired special programs for children (“Discovery Jones”[6]) and teens (“Steelroots”[7]).
The development of original entertainment content became a focus after the 2010 re-brand,[8] beginning with A Walton’s Family Reunion, starring surviving cast members of The Waltons who journey back to Walton’s Mountain almost 30 years after the series ended its iconic run.
In 2011, a short-form series entitled Moments was launched. Seen exclusively on INSP, Moments is an original, short-form inspirational video series that ranges in formats like documentary, narrative, and interviews, with each sharing an uplifting story. One of the short videos featured, "Thank You For Your Service", quickly went viral and has been featured on ABC’s The View, the Pentagon Channel, and USAA’s web site, as well as several national conventions and conferences, to include the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Vietnam Veterans of America, Jewish War Veterans, Society of Air Force Nurses, and the League of POW/MIA Families. In 2013, INSP was honored by the Vietnam War Commemoration for Thank You For Your Service. General Claude “Mick” Kicklighter noted the video’s impact; “This stirring tribute never fails to inspire deep emotions. It has helped bring healing and encouragement to true patriots, many of whom have felt taken for granted and ignored.”[9] INSP currently is in production on another veteran series entitled, “Moments of Valor,” a joint partnership with the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation.[10]
Old Henry is series of interstitials on INSP that starred Ralph Waite (The Waltons) and Rachel Hendrix (October Baby). The drama initially aired in October 2013 as a series of six interstitials, with a 30-minute version produced to incorporate the entire series along with never before-seen-footage and exclusive interviews.
In early 2014, INSP moved forward in their commitment to original content, creating the position of Vice President of Original Programming.[11]
Facilities and studio[edit]
INSP originally was headquartered in studios and offices in Charlotte, North Carolina. The broadcast facility remains in Charlotte, while the network's offices have been relocated to a newly constructed campus known as CrossRidge (formerly named the City of Light) in Indian Land, South Carolina, a Charlotte suburb.[12][13] All of the network's operations and broadcast facilities are eventually to be consolidated in planned facilities to be ultimately constructed at the South Carolina campus.[citation needed]
Accolades[edit]
INSP has been honored with several industry awards in television:

2012: The PTC Seal of Approval from the Parents Television Council[14]
2012: CableFAXIES Awards finalist in two categories; Trade Show Marketing/PR and Direct Response Marketing[15][16]
2013: Nominated in the Category for Human Concerns at The New York Film & Television Festival[17]
2014: CableFax Digital Awards finalist in their Social Good Campaign for Moments.org[18]
2014: Telly Awards:

The Silver award in the Category of Entertainment for Going Home[19]
The Bronze award in the Category of Entertainment for Italian Family[20]
The Bronze award in the Category of Use of Humor for Italian Family
