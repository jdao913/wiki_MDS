History[edit]
In 1983, founder, Helen Hernandez met with prolific television writer and producer Norman Lear.[4] "Lear was acutely aware of the near absence of positive portrayals of Latinos in the entertainment industry and understood the importance of positive images. The two met with leaders of the National Conference for Community and Justice, a respected non-sectarian human relations organization committed to fighting prejudice and racial tensions".[5]
The result was the Imagen Foundation Awards competition (or Imagen Awards), established in 1985.[6]
Past honorees include such entertainment industry professionals as Andy García, Antonio Banderas, Phil Roman, Edward James Olmos, Bill Meléndez, Rita Moreno, Jennifer Lopez, and Héctor Elizondo.
