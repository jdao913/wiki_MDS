ImaginAsian Entertainment was a multimedial company based in New York City. Its main feature was a television network, iaTV, which premiered in 2004 and which focuses on entertainment featuring Mid- to South-East Asian performers. There is also some South Asian content. The channel competed in certain markets with AZN Television until April 2008, when the competing network ceased broadcasting. It is not yet available in many U.S. televisual markets. The company ceased in 2011, with the television network becoming MNet.
They also operated The ImaginAsian, a renovated movie theatre located in Midtown Manhattan that shows only first-run and classic East Asian films, as well as several film festivals per year. The company renovated a second former movie theatre in Los Angeles that opened in December 2007, the former Linda Lea Theater, which originally showed Japanese films and served the Little Tokyo area before shuttering in the 1980s.
In addition, past divisions of the company consisted of iaLink, ImaginAsian Entertainment's monthly on-line magazine, which at one point had over ten million subscribers, ImaginAsian Pictures and Home Entertainment, a film and DVD distribution division that released several DVDs of East Asian films and iaTV original shows, and the successful theatrical and DVD release of the Vietnamese American film Journey From The Fall, and iaRadio, a block of radio programming both streamed on-line as well as made available on certain terrestrial stations.
