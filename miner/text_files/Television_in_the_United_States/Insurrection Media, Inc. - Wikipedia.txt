Insurrection Media is an independent digital TV studio founded by Kiliaen Van Rensselaer in 2015.[1][2][3] It develops and produces scripted content for over-the-top video platforms as well as broadcast and cable networks internationally.[4]
History[edit]
Insurrection has multi-year SciFi production partnership with The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman and David Alpert of Skybound Entertainment[5][6] and a multi-year exclusive comedy pod deal with Jonathan Stern (Wet Hot American Summer, Childrens Hospital),[7] founder of Abominable Pictures, and senior entertainment executive and producer Keith Quinn (Paramount Digital, LivePlanet),.[8] The company has a strategic relationship with HarperCollins where key books in SciFi, Drama and Comedy are optioned and developed into digital video and linear television series.[9]
Insurrection announced the series order of its show Drive Share for a U.S. exclusive first window on Verizon Hearst Media Partners' millennial-focused multi-platform digital video channel, Seriously.TV.[10][11] From creators Rob Huebel (Transparent) and Paul Scheer (The League), the ten half-hour episodes premiered late 2016 on Seriously.TV in shorter form chapters[12] and will be distributed internationally as half-hours by Insurrection Media.[13][14][15][16][17]
Insurrection Media has partnered with Keshet Digital Studios to coproduce paranormal YA drama The Dead Girls Detective Agency based on the HarperCollins book written by Suzy Cox. TV Writing team Jerica Lieberman and Molly Margraf (ABC's Mistresses) will pen the adaptation of the pilot. Production begins March 2017.[18]
On March 29, 2017, Insurrection and Complex Networks announced the series order of scripted comedy Liberty Crossing. The eight half-hour episodes will be an Insurrection production in association with MXN Entertainment and premiere later this year. Production begins in May. Created and executive produced by Emmy nominated Daniel Radosh (The Daily Show) & Michael Harrison, executive produced by Oscar-nominated Mason Novick (Juno, 500 Days of Summer, Young Adult), Michelle Knudsen (Bad Words, Hidden), Emmy-nominated Deborah Henderson (Snow in August, The Two of Us) and directed by Todd Berger (It's a Disaster, The Scenesters). Justin Killion and Cory Stern will executive produce for Complex Networks.[19]
Senior executive Deborah Henderson serves as General Counsel and Head of Production overseeing all aspects of corporate, legal, and business affairs as well as the launch and supervision of the company's production arm specializing in digital video content.[20] Veteran executive and young-adult novelist Jordanna Fraiberg is appointed Head of Development, overseeing Insurrection's production slate as well as strategic partnerships with Skybound Entertainment, Abominable Pictures and HarperCollins.[21]
