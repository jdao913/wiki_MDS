History[edit]
Jewelry Television was founded as "America's Collectibles Network" (ACN) in 1993 by Jerry Sisk, Jr., Bob Hall, and Bill Kouns.[3][4][5][6] Sisk was a graduate gemologist, Kouns was a jewelry expert, and Hall had previously worked in the television industry.[4]
The fledgling network began broadcasting from a studio in Greeneville, Tennessee, with just one television camera.[4] ACN initially sold gemstones, jewelry and collectible coins.[7] Sisk, Hall and Kouns later moved the network to a larger headquarters and television studio in Knoxville.[4]
In 2002, the company relaunched as Jewelry Television and has since focused on selling gemstones, jewelry and jewelry-making kits.[6]
In 2006, Jewelry Television bought competitor Shop at Home and its assets from Scripps.[8] On June 21, 2006, Jewelry Television replaced Shop at Home on Shop at Home-affiliated stations owned by Scripps.[9][10]
Jewelry Television has approximately 1,200 employees, as of January 2013.[4]
Overview[edit]
Jewelry Television airs 24 hours a day, although programming hours vary between each region, based on the local TV provider. In October 2008 the network began broadcasting in high definition.[11]
The network also offers online streaming of its network through its website JTV.com, which is the third largest jewelry website according to Internet Retailer’s Top 500 Guide for 2012.[12]
In April 2012, Jewelry Television launched the Titanic Jewelry Collection. Created in partnership with Titanic Museum Attractions, this proprietary collection offers pieces in the Art Nouveau and Edwardian styles typical of that era.[13]
Lawsuits[edit]
On March 26, 2008, Jewelry Television filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Tennessee against Lloyd's of London, as a result of a criminal scheme that took place in 2006 and 2007. A person had used a bank account of the Office of the Comptroller of the City of New York to buy more than $3.5 million in jewelry.[14]
On May 23, 2008, a $5 million class action lawsuit was filed in California against Jewelry Television. The suit alleged that since 2003 the shopping network has sold a gemstone called andesine-labradorite without disclosing its treatment, while promising buyers that this stone was rare and untreated.[15] On June 2, 2008, Jewelry Television said andesine-labradorite has been sold in the gem trade since 2002 as natural and untreated material. "Lab reports from major laboratories have consistently confirmed these gemstones as natural and untreated. Jewelry Television, like other major retailers, relied upon the lab reports and general industry information".[16]
On May 19, 2009, an age discrimination lawsuit was filed against Jewelry Television alleging an employee had been terminated as part of a company-wide reduction in workforce the previous May.[17]
