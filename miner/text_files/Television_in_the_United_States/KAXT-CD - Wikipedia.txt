History[edit]
KAXT-CA was a low-power analog class A television station. The station previously broadcast in analog on UHF channel 22 as a network affiliate of Spanish-language Christian television Tiempos Finales TV, formerly being an affiliate of TBN from 1990 to 2003, and of Almavision from 2003 to 2006.
On July 31, 2009, KAXT began ATSC digital TV transmissions on UHF channel 42, which had been vacated by KTNC-TV. (The previous month, KTVU/KICU-TV owner Cox Enterprises unsuccessfully applied for a license to use the same frequency for a KTVU digital translator.[3]) KAXT's digital transmissions used the call sign KAXT-LD, later KAXT-CD. The station was the first digital television station to broadcast 12 video streams on a standard 6 MHz 19.39 Mbit/s ATSC stream. Using statistical multiplexing technology in the encoders and multiplexer, the system provides variable bit rate compression needed to provide full quality standard definition video across all of the channels with enough bandwidth for radio (audio only) services.
Broadcast Engineering nominated KAXT as Station of the Year for 2009,[4] the first low power television station to receive such a distinction.
The DTV virtual channels between KAXT-LD's Channel 22 (physical: 42, formerly 22) and KRCB's Channel 22 (physical: 23) Cotati, had significant overlap that caused a PSIP conflict, allowing KAXT-CD to move to a new virtual channel, Channel 1. KAXT operates with a PSIP of Channel 1, with 12 different video program streams and one audio-only channels for a total of 13 virtual channels.
Weigel Broadcasting agreed to acquire KAXT-CD and KTLN-TV, along with KVOS-TV and KFFV in Seattle, from OTA Broadcasting in a $23.2 million deal on October 18, 2017.[5]
Programming[edit]
KAXT broadcasts an electronic program guide, shopping channels, and several channels of ethnic news, entertainment, and religious programming. Several subchannels are produced locally, while the remainder are simulcasts. KAXT is the only television station in the United States that broadcasts on virtual channel 1.[6]
