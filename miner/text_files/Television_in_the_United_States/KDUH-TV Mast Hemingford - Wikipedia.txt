The KDUH-TV Mast was a 599 meter high guyed mast built in 1969 for TV transmitting at Hemingford, Nebraska in the US, at 42°10′21″N 103°13′59″W﻿ / ﻿42.17250°N 103.23306°W﻿ / 42.17250; -103.23306Coordinates: 42°10′21″N 103°13′59″W﻿ / ﻿42.17250°N 103.23306°W﻿ / 42.17250; -103.23306. The tower broadcast KDUH-TV of Scottsbluff, a semi-satellite of Rapid City, South Dakota-based KOTA-TV.
The tower collapsed on September 24, 2002 during reconstruction work. Two tower workers, Lawrence A. Sukalec, 59, of Valier, Illinois, and Daniel E. Goff, 25, of Sesser, Illinois, were killed in the process, and three were injured on the ground.
The collapse occurred as strengthening measures were being taken so the 30+ year-old tower could accommodate the added weight of Digital Television transmission facilities. Investigations later found that the contractors neglected to stabilize the tower while original structural components were being replaced with stronger ones.
KDUH-TV resumed full-power broadcasts one year later from the new Duhamel Broadcasting Tower Angora, near Angora, Nebraska.
