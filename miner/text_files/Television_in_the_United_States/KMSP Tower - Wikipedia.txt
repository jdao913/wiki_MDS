KMSP TV Tower is a 446.8 metre (1466 feet) high guy-wired aerial mast for the transmission of FM radio and television programs in Shoreview, Minnesota. The structure was apparently the tallest in Minnesota until the construction of the KPXM Tower in 1997.
The tower, which was built in 1971, is owned by KMSP channel 9 of Eden Prairie, Minnesota but is shared by several area broadcasters; WFTC channel 29 (KMSP's sister station) and the Twin Cities Public Television stations, KTCA 2 and KTCI 17. Several FM stations are also on the tower: KQRS-FM 92.5("KQ92"), KXXR 93.7 ("93X"), KTCZ 97.1 ("Cities 97"), KTIS-FM 98.5, KSJN 99.5, KFXN 100.3, KDWB 101.3, KEEY 102.1 ("K102"), KMNB 102.9 ("Buz'n 102.9"), and KZJK 104.1 ("Jack FM").
In 2001, a painter working on the tower died from asphyxia upon falling 500 feet down the structure.
