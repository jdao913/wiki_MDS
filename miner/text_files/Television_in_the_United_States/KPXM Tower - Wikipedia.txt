The KPXM Tower (formerly KXLI Tower) is the tallest structure in Minnesota, a guyed aerial mast rising 1505 feet (458.72 meters). It transmits the signal for KPXM virtual channel 41 (40 digital), which is an ION Television network affiliate licensed to serve St. Cloud, Minnesota. However, the tower is located about halfway between St. Cloud and the core of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, near the city of Big Lake.
The tower was completed in 1997 and is the property of American Tower. KXLI was the call sign of channel 41 when the tower was built. It surpassed the height of the KMSP Tower, completed in 1971.
The tallest non-guyed structures in the state are the IDS Tower (792 ft/241.4 m or 910 ft/277.3 m with rooftop antennas) and the Capella Tower (776 ft/236.5 m) in Minneapolis.
