Laff, legal name Laff Media, LLC, Me is an American digital multicast television network that is owned by Laff Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Katz Broadcasting. The network specializes in comedy programming, featuring a mix of feature films and archived sitcoms. Laff is targeted at adults between the ages of 18 and 49 years old.[2]
Originally, Katz sold the network to affiliated TV stations via ad split but by October 2015 had moved to a carriage fees in exchange for the network get the ad inventory due to greater inventory with stations adding a third or fourth subchannel.[3]1 Laff used direct response advertising as a meter of viewers before switching to Nielsen rating C-3 in late 2015.[3]3

History[edit]
Laff's launch was announced by Katz Broadcasting in January 2015 as having a scheduled launch date of 000000002015-04-15-0000April 15, 2015, which coincides with Tax Day in the United States, when tax returns are due and, as Broadcasting & Cable writer Jon Lafayette noted in an article on Laff's launch, "people will need something to make them smile."[4]
Katz announced that television stations owned by ABC Owned Television Stations and 13 E. W. Scripps Company would serve as the network's charter affiliates; the former serving as a replacement for the standard definition feed of the Live Well Network, which with Laff's announcement also began to roll-back to only being carried by ABCOTS stations.[5][6] On March 13, 2015, Katz Broadcasting announced an affiliation deal with the Cox Media Group to carry Laff on the subchannels of seven of its stations expanding its initial reach to 47% of the country.[7] The following week on March 20, as part of a multi-network affiliation agreement with Katz, the Meredith Corporation announced that it would carry the network on two of its stations.[8][9]
On February 13, 2015, Laff acquired the syndication rights to five sitcoms.[10] Laff followed that deal with three for film licensing with Walt Disney Studios, Miramax, and Sony Pictures Television by March 17.[11]
Programming[edit]
Laff's comedy-centered programming consists of a mix of theatrically released feature films, as well as off-network sitcoms.[2] Laff would set itself apart from its multicast competitors by carrying more contemporary programming content, in contrast to the reruns of series from the 1980s and earlier commonly found on other over-the-air networks which rely on acquired content.[5] The network also provide additional content via the network's website and mobile app.[12]
Movies[edit]
Laff's program schedule will have access to approximately 250 titles comedic films from the libraries of three film studios by virtue of multi-year program licensing agreements with Walt Disney Studios, Miramax, and Sony Pictures Entertainment (distributed by Sony Pictures Television).[11][13]
Television series[edit]
In addition to films, much of Laff's programming lineup consists of reruns of situation comedies of over 800 episodes.[11]
