List of RuPaul's Drag Race contestants - Wikipedia

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This is a list of contestants who have appeared on the American television show RuPaul's Drag Race. Contestants compete against each other and are progressively eliminated, until just a winner remains, who is crowned "next drag superstar". They are judged by drag queen RuPaul and her panel of judges. The series first aired in 2009 and as of 2017, there have been nine seasons of the show. A total of 113 different participants have been selected as finalists in the show in its eight years running, with nine drag queens — BeBe Zahara Benet, Tyra Sanchez, Raja, Sharon Needles, Jinkx Monsoon, Bianca Del Rio, Violet Chachki, Bob the Drag Queen, and Sasha Velour being crowned so far as "America's Next Drag Superstar". In addition, an All-Stars season aired in 2012 featuring twelve returning contestants from the first four seasons, each competing for a place in the "Drag Race Hall of Fame". The season was won by Chad Michaels, previously a runner-up in season four. In 2015, it was announced All Stars had been renewed and a second season premiered on August 25, 2016.[1] The second season was won by Alaska, who was previously a runner-up in season 5.[2]
Contestants usually apply to be on the show, or attend casting calls, but the series has been known to recruit contestants via online casting. Season 1 contestant Nina Flowers, season 2 contestant Jessica Wild, season 5 contestant Penny Tration, and season 6 contestant Darienne Lake were all selected to participate by an audience vote via the show's official website. RuPaul and Santino Rice personally chose season 3 contestants Venus D-Lite and Delta Work at an open casting call in Hollywood. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping.
Some contestants have identified as transgender during or after the competition. Season 2 contestant Sonique, season 3 contestant Carmen Carrera, season 4 contestants Kenya Michaels and Jiggly Caliente, season 5 contestant Monica Beverly Hillz, season 6 contestant Gia Gunn, and season 9 contestant Peppermint are the series' only transgender participants. Sonique, Carmen, Jiggly, Kenya and Gia competed while identifying as males and began identifying as transgender females after their respective eliminations. Monica was the first contestant in the history of the competition to participate while already identifying as female, though she only outed herself in the context of the show during filming of the second episode. Peppermint on Season 9 is the first contestant to be openly out as trans prior to the competition. Monica confirmed in an interview that the show does not require contestants to identify as male and that transgender females can participate if they still consider themselves drag artists.[3]
Currently, the first and only contestant to pass away is season 2 contestant Sahara Davenport, who died in October 2012 at age 27.[4] Davenport was in a long-term relationship with season 3 contestant Manila Luzon at the time.

RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars[edit]
Since 2012, World of Wonder has produced two seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, a spin-off series where past contestants return to compete for a spot in the Drag Race Hall of Fame. The first season premiered on October 22, 2012 on the Logo network and featured a new format in which the twelve contestants would be competing and eliminated as pairs until the final episode when one member of from both remaining pairs would have the chance to win the crown.
In 2015, it was announced that the series would return to Logo for a second season. Premiering on August 25, 2012, ten past contestants returned to compete and the show's format returned to one more similar to the main series; however, it was revealed that RuPaul would not be eliminating anyone and that the queen who won each main challenge would have to select a low-performing queen to send home.
All information is accurate as of the time the season was filmed.

     Contestant returned to the competition after being eliminated.

Notes[edit]



^ a b c d e f This contestant won Miss Congeniality in her original season.
^ This contestant chose to leave the competition.




^1 Contestants' ages are at the time of their respective season's filming.
^2 She maintains Sonique as a stage name, but has legally changed her name to Kylie Sonique Love.
^3 Carmen entered the competition amidst transitioning, stopping treatment just before and during her time on the show to meet the requirements to compete. After being eliminated, she began her transition to live full-time as female. She now goes by Carmen Carrera both professionally and personally.
^4 Starting from season 4, the winner was chosen from the final three contestants, and no specific position was announced between the remaining two. Thus, the two losing finalists are both listed as runner-up.
^5 Vivienne and Honey were both eliminated in the same episode, placing them both in the 10th/11th finishing place.
^6 In season 6, there were two opening episodes, Kelly and Magnolia were eliminated in their respective openings, before the contestants merged into one group, placing them both in the 14th/13th finishing place.
^7 Laila and Dax were both eliminated in the same episode, placing them both in the 11th/12th finishing place
