ABC Productions (ABCP) was a television production company that was a division of ABC Television Network Group. While the ABC network had first shot at the unit's shows, the company was allowed to shop shows to other networks[4] and was the first to sell to another network.[6] The company was set up increase the control and financial rewards of producing its own TV shows.[4]

History

ABC Productions was formed in 1989 as ABC Network's in-house production unit after the alteration of the fin-syn rules[6] that increased network ownership to only 40% of prime-time programs.[4] Former ABC Motion Pictures president[4] and ABC Entertainment president Brandon Stoddard on March 21, 1989 to head up the then unnamed production unit.[5]
By early 1991, ABC Productions had purchased Andrew Adelson Co. then signed Andrew Adelson to an exclusive production contract. [9] By May 1991, ABCP produced eight pilots, a series, a miniseries and several TV movies. "My Life and Times" was the company's first series production placed with the ABC network and debuted in May 1991, but was yanked after the ratings dropped 19% from week 1 to 2, so as to avoid May sweeps. While its first miniseries, "An Inconvenient Woman" was shown on ABC in the May sweeps[4] was produced by Adelson.[9] For Lifetime, ABCP produced a telefilm, 'Stop at Nothing'.[4] Former Cosby Show co-executive producer Elliot Shonman for ABCP created, written and produced Coconut Downs while agreeing to a two-year exclusivity deal. Also signing production deals by June 1991 were Martthew Carlson (an extension), Steve Kronish and Norman Morrill. 29 projects were under development.[9]
By the 1994-95 season, ABC Productions was providing half of ABC's regular series programming.[10] DreamWorks Television was formed in December 1994 as DreamWorks Studios agreed to a $200 million seven-year TV production joint venture with Capital Cities/ABC.[11] ABCP placed "The Boys are Back" with CBS for the 1994-1995 season.[12]
In June 1995, Stoddard stepped down as ABC Productions president.[13] On June 7, 1996 due to the merger with Disney, Capital Cities/ABC indicated that its ABC Productions division operations would be shut down while keeping its boutique production companies: Victor Television Productions, ABC/Kane Productions, DIC Entertainment and Greengrass Productions.[6][7] ABCP executive in charge Brian McAndrews continued managing ABC's other production arms for TV movies, documentaries and children's programming and production interests with DreamWorks SKG, Brillstein-Grey Entertainment and Jim Henson Productions.[7] McAndrews left in early March 1998 for an ABC Sports position, while Greengrass Productions was folded into ABC Entertainment and its telefilm unit, ABC Pictures, would finish its last five projects then disband.[8]

ACF was granted a larger budget (by $250,000) and half an hour longer than the movie of the week thus considered a prestige or "A" movie. Circle's films were shown on Sunday night where they alternated with recent feature films and on Monday night after the end of Monday Night Football.[ABCMOW 1] With the 1972-1973 season, ACF began producing films for Movie of the Week including Pursuit.[ABCMOW 2] Along with Picturemaking Productions, they served as production company for Moonlighting, with their last credit being the finale of the show.

ABC Motion Pictures was a production company of ABC that operated from May 1979.[28] Fox was the company's distributor. Until October 1985, the division produced theatrical films along with TV movies, series and mini-series.[29]

History

ABC Motion Pictures was found in May 1979 with Brandon Stoddard as president.[30] Soon the division was swapped with old film projects. While a boutique would make only a few films per year, Stoddard figured that ABC would succeed in movie production as there were additional revenue sources from video cassettes and cable on top of theater ticket sales and broadcast TV sales.[28] ABC Motion Pictures was incorporated by June 11, 1980.[31]
The division waited two years to get its first slate of three films into production with National Lampoon's Class Reunion just an announcement and Young Doctors in Love beginning production in December 1981 under the theatrical directorial debut of Garry Marshall. In June 1982, "Chain Reaction" (later "Silkwood"[29]) starring Meryl Streep was expected to be in production.[32]




The Flamingo Kid after released by Fox did well but not strong business, Fox pulled the film from release so as to stop spending money on advertising.[29]
With networks getting better rating for their own movies of the week over films released on cable and cassettes, networks reduced licensing of theatrical films. Additional boutique production companies entered the market at the same time crowding the market and increasing filming costs. With films distributed by a major studio, ABC's films were slotted in less desirable release dates. On October 28, 1985, ABC shut down ABC Motion Pictures theatrical motion picture operation after the release of only 6 theatrical films[29] which was within weeks of CBS shutting down CBS Theatrical Films.[28] The unit released one last movie, "SpaceCamp", already produced in the summer of 1986.[18] The unit would continue producing TV movies and mini-series while increasing TV series output. A Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation media analyst forecast ABC's losses on its theatrical operations for 1985 to be $5 million.[29]
