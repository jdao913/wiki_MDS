Overview[edit]
Unlike other prizes in journalism[citation needed] (such as the George Foster Peabody Awards, the George Polk Awards, the National Journalism Awards and the Pulitzer Prizes), the Livingston Awards judge print, broadcast, and online entries against one another.
Mollie Parnis Livingston, one of America’s first fashion designers known by name, established the Livingston Awards in 1981 to honor her son, Robert, who published the journalism review More.[3] For thirty years, The Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation, headed by Livingston’s nephew Neal Hochman, sponsored the awards. Recent supporters include the Indian Trail Foundation, Christiane Amanpour, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and the University of Michigan.
The winners are selected by the Livingston Board of National Judges. These include Christiane Amanpour, Ken Auletta, Dean Baquet, Charles Gibson, Ellen Goodman, John F. Harris, Clarence Page, and Anna Quindlen. Mike Wallace was one of the national judges for several years.[4]
