LocusPoint Networks LLC is the owner of several television stations in the United States. The company is 99% owned by The Blackstone Group.
One of the company's recent acquisitions, WMGM-TV, was rumored to have been purchased only to be sold in a spectrum auction in 2015.[1] When the FCC auction finally occurred LocusPoint failed to successfully win a bid to sell the station's spectrum to the FCC. On June 26, 2017, LocusPoint Networks agreed to sell WMGM-TV to Univision Communications, through its Univision Local Media subsidiary, for $6 million.[2] The deal will make WMGM-TV a sister station to WUVP-DT and WFPA-CD.
In February 2017, LocusPoint announced it would sell WDWO-CD to Tri-State Christian Television.[3]
As of April 12, 2017, LocusPoint Networks, hired by the San Mateo Community College District to sell KCSM-TV in the spectrum auction, claimed fiscal mismanagement by school officials and administrators to fulfill their basic duties to facilitate the sale properly. The station was to be sold in the auction due to the college's $1 million annual losses. In turn, the District has counter-sued LocusPoint and its partner, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for failure to enter KCSM-TV into the FCC auction.[4]
On April 13, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that LocusPoint's WLPH-CD and WQVC-CD were successful bidders in the spectrum auction. WLPH-CD, which had already been silent since LocusPoint acquired it in 2014, would be surrendering its license in exchange for $3,994,492 and WQVC-CD would be surrendering its license in exchange for $11,196,327.[5] LocusPoint surrendered the licenses for both stations to the FCC for cancellation on August 8, 2017.
