MGM HD is a moribund high-definition television cable network. It features movies from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library of approximately 1,200 movies mastered in a high-definition-compatible format.[1] The network exists largely because MGM does not have to pay to license their own films, and (with a few occasional exceptions) the schedule is composed mostly of second-tier and less-popular films that are not wanted or licensed by other major networks and movie channels. The films are usually presented uncut and in their original aspect ratio, although some films are edited for content for daytime viewing and commercial breaks are often added during peak viewing hours.
