2016 had the highest number of first time finalists. Ambitiouz Entertainment has three artists appearing on the list, all for the first time: newcomers Emtee, FiFi Cooper and A-Reece. Emtee made the highest jump from non-appearance in the previous years to number 2 this year.
A-Reece is the youngest artist to appear on the list, being only a month younger than Nasty C.
This year's list debuted the highest number of Under 25's.
Rashid Kay and Spoken Priestess's decisions received mixed to negative reception from television viewers while others questioned Rashid Kay's elegibility to be a panellist for this year's segment.
Kwesta and Cassper Nyovest are the only artists included since the list's inception to consistently rise to a higher rank each subsequent year.
