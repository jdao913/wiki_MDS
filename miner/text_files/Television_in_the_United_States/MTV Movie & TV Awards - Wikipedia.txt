The MTV Movie & TV Awards (formerly known as the MTV Movie Awards)[1] is a film and television awards show presented annually on MTV. The nominees are decided by producers and executives at MTV. Winners are decided online by the general public. Presently voting is done through MTV's official website through a Movie & TV Awards voting website.[2] The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards took place on May 7, 2017 and featured the first time men and women competing jointly in the acting categories.[1] Winners are presented with the "golden popcorn" statue, made by New York firm, Society Awards.[3]

Production process[edit]
Unlike its sister event MTV Video Music Awards (which are broadcast live), the MTV Movie Awards (up to 2007) were taped and then broadcast a few days later.[4] The entire production was taped in a completely different order than what the MTV viewing audience saw. For example, the show's host would tape all his/her monologues and introductions at one time, and all the musical acts would perform one after the other. Celebrities would often only appear at the live taping for the announcement of their award category, and members of the general audience fill-in their vacant seats during the other times. Through editing, MTV was able to present to its viewing audience an awards show which appears to be taped in live sequence, with celebrities remaining for the entire show. This method of production allowed profanity to be edited from the show and also is more convenient for the celebrities. The actual live taping aired same-day on pay-per-view channels in most metropolitan cities around the world. Some awards telecasts had also been shown in television syndication. However, in 2007, this changed, as MTV and Survivor producer Mark Burnett (who took over duties from Joel Gallen for the 2007 awards) announced that the 2007 edition would be broadcast live on MTV for the first time on June 3, 2007 in Los Angeles.
The 2016 broadcast was the first show since 2006 not to air live as the event was taped on April 9, 2016 before airing on Viacom's MTV networks the following day on April 10.
Since 2007, polls for several awards were voted by online users on MTV's official website.

Special awards[edit]
MTV Lifetime Achievement Award[edit]
The Lifetime Achievement Award was a tongue-in-cheek award for movie personalities who made an impact on popular culture. Prior to announcing the winner MTV would air testimonials from major Hollywood celebrities praising the winners greatness while only offering a slight tease as to who the winner was. Following Clint Howard's win and emotional reaction the award was discontinued.

1992: Jason Voorhees
1993: The Three Stooges
1994: Richard Roundtree
1995: Jackie Chan
1996: Godzilla
1997: Chewbacca
1998: Clint Howard

It was awarded to three fictional characters (Godzilla, Jason Voorhees, and Chewbacca) and Richard Roundtree's win was for his performance as John Shaft.
MTV Generation Award[edit]
The MTV Generation Award is the successor to the MTV Lifetime Achievement Award, though it is more serious than its predecessor. The recipient of the award is celebrated for great achievement in movies. The distinction "is given to an artist who has shown us a variety of impressive roles, a personal and professional flair and of course, an awesome level of talent."[5]

2015: Robert Downey, Jr.
2016: Will Smith[6]

MTV Silver Bucket of Excellence[edit]
The Silver Bucket of Excellence is an award that was given to a film that has made lasting impact on moviegoers and the MTV audience.[7] It was further defined in 2006 as honoring a "film of the past that resonates with even more meaning today."[8]

2005: The Breakfast Club – awarded to Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy
2006: Do the Right Thing – awarded to Spike Lee

MTV Trailblazer Award[edit]
The MTV Trailblazer Award recipient spearheads the way for others that work in the movie industry.

Film parodies[edit]
Since 1993, scenes are spoofed, mostly from that year's most popular films, although television shows and older movies have also been chosen. This may include sound and video montages, replacing some of the original cast with other actors (commonly, the hosts of each year's show) generally mocking the scenes of that film. The diversity of the spoofs can vary greatly, from one dialogue (such as in 2005) to several long scenes, including fighting and action sequences (2003).
