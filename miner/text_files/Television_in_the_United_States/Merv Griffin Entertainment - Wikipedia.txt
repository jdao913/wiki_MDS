Merv Griffin Entertainment is an American production company founded by American media mogul Merv Griffin on May 13, 1996.[1] It is a successor to Merv Griffin Enterprises. Its productions include revivals of recent franchises (such as Dance Fever, revived in 2003 for the Freeform (TV channel), formerly ABC Family and originally CBN Satellite Service). Griffin's company is part of The Griffin Group. Merv Griffin Entertainment owns The Merv Griffin Show and Dance Fever, but Sony Pictures Television handles television distribution rights. The television division was run by Yani-Brune Entertainment from 2005 to 2008; hand-picked by Griffin himself. In 2008, ShineReveille International made a deal with Merv Griffin Entertainment to distribute all of MGE programming overseas.
Griffin's previous production company was Merv Griffin Enterprises, which he sold to The Coca-Cola Company on May 5, 1986.
