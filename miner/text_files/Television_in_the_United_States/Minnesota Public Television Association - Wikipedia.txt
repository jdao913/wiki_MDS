The Minnesota Public Television Association (MPTA), also commonly known as Minnesota Public Television, is a not-for-profit trade organization of public television stations in the state of Minnesota that operates an interconnecting statewide educational television network serving residents of Minnesota. The MPTA network is two-way; distributing programming to and from each member station. It also tries to keep state funding for public television in the Minnesota budget.
