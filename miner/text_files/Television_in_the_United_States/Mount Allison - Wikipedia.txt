Geography[edit]
Mount Allison is part of a ridge that also includes Mission Peak and Monument Peak. Unlike those other two peaks, Mount Allison is located on unincorporated private property owned by a broadcasting company.[2]
Broadcasting antennas[edit]
Owned by Communication and Control, Inc. (CCI), a large free-standing broadcasting antenna on Mount Allison broadcasts two Spanish channels, channel 14 (Univision KDTV) and channel 48 (Telemundo KSTS). Erected on February 25, 1998, the antenna is 443 feet (135 m) high and has three prongs at the top. Several smaller towers and dishes are also present.[3]
