NBC Studios are located in the historic 30 Rockefeller Plaza (on Sixth Avenue between 49th and 50th streets) in the borough of Manhattan, New York City. The building houses the NBC television network headquarters, its parent NBC Universal, and NBC's flagship station WNBC (Channel 4), as well as cable news channel MSNBC.
The first NBC Radio City Studios began operating in the early 1930s. Tours of the studios began in 1933, suspended in 2014 and resumed on October 26, 2015. Because of the preponderance of radio studios, that section of the Rockefeller Center complex became known as Radio City (and gave its name to Radio City Music Hall). Even into the present decade, tickets for shows based at 30 Rock bear the legend "Radio City".
