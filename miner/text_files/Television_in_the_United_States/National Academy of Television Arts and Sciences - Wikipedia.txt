The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) was created in 1955 to advance the arts and sciences of television.[1] Headquartered in New York, NATAS's membership is national and the organization has local chapters around the country. It was also known as the National Television Academy until 2007.
One of its past presidents, Don DeFore, was instrumental in arranging for the Emmy Awards to be broadcast on national TV for the first time on March 7, 1955. Other past presidents include John Cannon, Peter Price and Frank Radice.
NATAS distributes several groups of Emmy Awards, including the Daytime Emmy Awards, the Sports Emmy Awards, the News and Documentary Emmy Awards, the Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards, and "Public Service".
NATAS also supervised the primetime Emmy Awards until a split between the East and West memberships in the 1970s led to the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences leaving NATAS. ATAS supervises the primetime and Los Angeles area Emmys, while NATAS is in charge of the other Emmy honors. In 2007, the organization spawned a peer organization dedicated to new media, called the National Academy of Media Arts & Sciences (NAMAS).[2]
NATAS publishes a magazine, Television Quarterly, which started in 1962.[3][4]
Local NATAS chapters organize award ceremonies of their own, handing out Emmy statues similar to those given out at the national ceremonies.[5]
