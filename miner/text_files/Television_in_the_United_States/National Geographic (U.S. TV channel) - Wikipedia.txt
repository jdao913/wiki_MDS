National Geographic (formerly National Geographic Channel and also commercially abbreviated and trademarked as Nat Geo or Nat Geo TV) is an American digital cable and satellite television network that is owned by National Geographic Partners, majority-owned by 21st Century Fox with the remainder owned by the National Geographic Society.
The flagship channel airs non-fiction television programs produced by National Geographic and other production companies. Like History and Discovery Channel, the channel features documentaries with factual content involving nature, science, culture, and history, plus some reality and pseudo-scientific entertainment programming. Its primary sister network worldwide, including the United States, is Nat Geo Wild, which focuses on animal-related programming, including the popular Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan.
As of February 2015, National Geographic is available to approximately 86,144,000 pay television households (74% of households with television) in the United States.[1]

Overview[edit]
In September 1997, the first National Geographic Channels were launched in the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia.[2] In July 1998, National Geographic Channel Asia was launched in partnership and distribution with STAR TV (before replacing NBC Asia Channel; the same happened after NBC Europe's demise in 1998). Today, the channel is available in over 143 countries, seen in more than 160 million homes and in 25 languages.
Being the first country in Latin America to receive the channel, broadcasts from Brazil started substituting the independent channel Superstation channel on November 1, 2000 released by FOX Latin American Channels.[3] According to people connected to the channel, it was first launched in the country due to the sales success of the magazine National Geographic.[3]
In the United States, the National Geographic Channel, launched on January 12, 2001, is a joint venture of National Geographic Television & Film and Fox Cable Networks. National Geographic provides programming expertise and the Fox Networks Group provides its expertise on distribution, marketing, and advertising sales. In the same year a Latin American version of the channel was released.[3]

Nat Geo Kids[edit]
Main articles: Nat Geo Kids (Latin American TV channel) and Nat Geo Kids (Brazilian TV channel)
Nat Geo Kids is cable TV channel broadcasting kids, and was launched on Latin America in July 1, 2017 and Brazil in Octubre 3, 2017.[11]
In the press[edit]
In 2013, the network began airing the reality show Are You Tougher Than a Boy Scout?. National Geographic Channel was criticized for their association with the Boy Scouts of America, an organization which, until a vote in May of that year that overturned its ban, had forbidden openly gay members.[12]
Archaeologists have protested that National Geographic shows such as Diggers and Nazi War Diggers promote the looting and destruction of archaeological sites by promoting the work of metal detecting souvenir hunters and collectable dealers.[13] In 2013 the National Geographic Channel set off a firestorm of controversy with its reality show Diggers. Professional archaeologists from the Society for Historical Archaeology, the largest scholarly group concerned with the archaeology of the modern world (A.D. 1400–present), roundly criticized the network for promoting the theft of cultural materials on public and private land.[14] The show Nazi War Diggers was accused of showing unscientific and disrespectful handling of human remains. A promotional quote from a military relic dealer, "I feel that by selling things that are Nazi-related and for lots of money, I am preserving things that museums don't want to deal with," was removed from the channel's website in March 2014. National Geographic expressed regret for how the series was presented by its own website but maintained that many of the accusations against the series were based on misinformation.[15] The program was subsequently pulled from the schedules while National Geographic reviewed allegations against the series.[16] The show was repackaged, amid controversy, as Battlefield Recovery for air during 2016 on Channel 5 in the UK.[17]
