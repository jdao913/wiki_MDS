The New Paradigm Broadcast Network or NPBN is a broadcast television network in the United States scheduled to launch for the 2009-2010 broadcast season. NPBN features shows created for African-American and Latino audiences that are “positive, affirming, and empowering.”
NPBN is based in Los Angeles, California. The network’s broadcast launch is planned for 10 major media markets, including Los Angeles, Washington DC and Chicago.
The network has made public the descriptions of three shows: “Everything,” “In The Park,” and “How they Got In.”
On April 16, 2009, the new twork announced its website, NPBN.com. NPBN.com will serve “to enlist visitors in shaping NPBN programming and encourages visitors to share ideas, thoughts, videos, and other materials through innovative tools to create a vibrant, engaged and active online community,” according to the press release.
NPBN also operates the Digital Media Academy, which hosts content from student artists online to “help to ensure that there is a pipeline of diverse talent to feed the broadcasting and entertainment industries for years to come.” The Digital Media Academy has partnered with five colleges including the University of Southern California and Georgia Tech.
Landon Taylor is the Founder, Chairman, and CEO of NPBN.
