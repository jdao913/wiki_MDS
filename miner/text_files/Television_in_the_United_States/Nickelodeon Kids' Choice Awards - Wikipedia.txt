The Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards (also known as the KCAs, Kids' Choice , or Kids' Choice Awards) is an American 90-minute-long annual awards show that airs on Nickelodeon. Usually held on a Saturday day, morning, or night in late March or early April, the show that honors the year's biggest television, movie, and music acts as voted by Nickelodeon viewers. Winners receive a hollow orange blimp figurine, a logo outline for much of the network's 1984–2009 era, which also functions as a kaleidoscope.[1]
The show features numerous celebrity guests and musical acts. In recent years, slime stunts have been incorporated into the show. The KCAs also host live entertainment. It has also been known to overwhelmingly cover people with the network's trademark green slime. The series SpongeBob SquarePants has won the most KCA awards, with fourteen overall through the series' run. Individually, Selena Gomez and Will Smith have both won the most trophies with ten, followed by, Amanda Bynes (7). Whoopi Goldberg is the only person to have won a Kids' Choice Award, along with the mainstream "EGOT" combination of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. Rosie O'Donnell has hosted the show most times (8), followed by Jack Black (3).

History
Alan Goodman, Albie Hecht, and Fred Seibert created the awards show after Nickelodeon produced a show called The Big Ballot[2][3][4][5][6][7] in 1987[8], named for the ballots kids voted with. To vote, the viewers would send in ballots and then before the show, the ballots would be counted and the winners would tape a thank you video that would be shown during the program. Goodman, Hecht, and Seibert felt that the network needed a bigger, more exciting platform.
Hecht selected the awards logo from a series of network designs created by original logo designers Tom Corey and Scott Nash (Corey McPherson Nash, Boston), overseen by Goodman and Seibert (Fred/Alan, Inc., New York).[9] The award was configured into the current blimp shape/kaleidoscope in 1990. The only change to the award since that time has been to change the embossed logotype on the side of the trophy for 2010 to fit the network's new logo typeface.
As the Internet came into widespread use, the voting eventually moved from a combination of 900 number telephone voting and ballots either mailed or completed at Pizza Hut locations, to moving exclusively online to the network's website and by 2007, text messaging. Early years of Internet voting had the early adoption complications of ballot stuffing and even adults voting before a new system where only one vote per Nick.com account became the procedure for voting on the awards (although it is probable adults still cast votes via the texting option, which is connected to a phone number only rather than a screenname, or by creating an account with a false age or having their children vote for a chosen subject instead). In 2010, an iPhone application and mobile browser voting was also added.[10]
The 2009 Kids' Choice Awards featured a new award called "The Big Green Help Award" which goes to the celebrity who goes above and beyond to help the Earth. The inaugural award was presented to Leonardo DiCaprio. For the 2010 awards, "The Big Green Help" award was renamed "The Big Help" award, with First Lady Michelle Obama winning the first award under the rename.
Unlike traditional awards shows, the Kids' Choice Awards uses other items to announce an award winner rather than a traditional envelope. The show sometimes uses balloons, T-shirts, models, giant letters, stickers (1999, where Amanda put a "Kick Me!" sticky on the model's back and somebody else put a sticker showing the winner's name). and even a foot (2008).
Voting for Canadians became available for the 2010 ceremony with the inauguration of Nickelodeon's Canadian service in November 2009.
In June 2010, Nickelodeon Latin America announced a Kids' Choice Awards for Mexico.[11] Other countries with their own Kids' Choice Awards include Brazil, United Kingdom, Australia, and Indonesia, which are either fully original local productions, or inserted as continuity during their broadcast of the American ceremony. The Australian Kids' Choice Awards had its last one in 2012.
In August 2011, Nickelodeon Latin America announced a Kids' Choice Awards for Argentina.
In June 2014, Nickelodeon Latin America announced a Kids' Choice Awards for Colombia.
In July 2014, Nickelodeon presented the Kids' Choice Sports awards, honoring kids' favorite athletes, teams and sports moments from the year. Michael Strahan produced and hosted the ceremony.[12]

Finishing up with the "Orange Carpet" for the Kids' Choice Awards outside of Pauley Pavilion, UCLA campus


The Kids' Choice Awards are typically held in and around Southern California. Previous ceremonies have been held at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California, the Hollywood Bowl, the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, and Universal Studios in Universal City, California, but mostly at Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA campus. After renovations to Pauley beginning in 2011, the show was moved to the Galen Center at USC;[13] it was expected to be a temporary home, but the network retained Galen for the 2012-14 ceremonies due to the construction of the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference and Guest Center, making it difficult to have the "Orange Carpet"; the smaller Kids' Choice Sports awards had its first ceremony in 2014 at Pauley. For the 2015 and 2016 shows, the ceremony occurred at the remodeled Forum in Inglewood, California. For the 2017 KCAs, it returned to the Galen Center.[14]

Special colored awards
These blimps are not orange like the regular blimps and the winners are chosen by the Nickelodeon staff, not the viewers. There is the gold Hall of Fame Award (1991–2000), the silver Wannabe Award (2001–2008), the green Big Green Help Award (2009), the silver glitter Big Help Award (2010–2012), and the Lifetime Achievement Award (2014–present).
The Hall of Fame Award
The Hall of Fame Award (a gold version of the Blimp award) was presented to those whose accomplishments, fame and popularity set them above everyone else. Initially, the award was chosen by the kids from a slate of nominees. Actors, athletes and singers were all eligible for the award, with ballots containing nominees from multiple categories.

The final slime at the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards


During a ceremony, sometimes a celebrity might not know when they are going to be slimed onstage or offstage, though it is meant as an honor, rather than the comedic humiliation of where the concept originated, with the early Nickelodeon series You Can't Do That on Television. Hosts have also been slimed, mostly in the finale of the show. Below is a list of all the celebrities that have been slimed over the past years at the Kids' Choice Awards. No celebrity sliming took place in 1992 as the entire audience was slimed instead.

Slime stunts
Started in 2002, the show began its annual World Record Slime Stunts. Olympians, extreme sports stars and daredevils participate in special stunts performed live on national television—often involving landing into the trademark green slime.

Stunt synopsis


2002
Dave Mirra
The BMX pro-biker broke his own record for a double back flip on a BMX bike and landed in a 5,000 gallon tank of green slime.


2003
Tony Hawk
The skateboarding champion skateboarded into an 11,000 gallon tank of green slime.


2004
Mat Hoffman
The BMX pro performed the "World Record Skydiving Bike Jump" landing in a lakefull of green slime.


2005
Donald Trump
The billionaire, at the time enjoying a resurgence of popularity with his TV series The Apprentice, "fired" a human cannonball into the air, landing in a net laced with green slime.


2006
Ryan St. Onge
In a live remote from the Utah Olympic Park in Park City, Utah, the U.S. Olympic Freestyle Aerial Skier skied into 10,000 gallons of green slime.


2007
Ron Jones
Bungee jumping into a pool of slime.


2008
Jack Black
Orlando Bloom
Kids Choice 2008 had many slime stunts all hosted by professional boxer Laila Ali. Depending on the outcome of the stunt, a certain amount of green slime was added to a slime vat backstage which was called throughout as the "Slime Meter". The slime was used later on at the end of the show, in supposedly the "World's Longest Celebrity Sliming," in which Orlando Bloom joined host Jack Black to be slimed for one solid minute. Host Black even remarked about how 27 tons of slime (the grand total) could fit in a vat that only held 25 tons.


Akon
In the first stunt, affectionately called the "Slime-o-Lition Derby", the pop star had 45 seconds to ride the Kids' Choice Bobble Head Kart. The choices were the shark-themed "Jaws Jalopy", a hot dog-shaped "Weiner Wagon" and the winner, the Jack Black Bobble Head Kart which was essentially a go-kart with a giant Jack Black head on the top. Akon successfully completed the course adding 10 tons of slime to the vat, "plus 5 for finishing" bringing the total to 15 tons.


Usher
The famous R&B singer performed the second stunt manning a "slime hose," firing at a sumo wrestler and propelling him in costume along a long platform. The amount of slime added to the vat was determined by how far the "human target" was propelled by the spray of slime. Viewers voting online picked the sumo wrestler over his competitor, the Scuba diver. The "human target" was launched all the way to the 5-ton mark bringing the total of slime in the vat to 20 tons.


Heidi Klum
The last stunt was performed by the supermodel or as host Black called her "Heidi the Human Dart". Klum was attached by a harness to a long cable, allowing her to swing freely in which she did. Armed with a pad of spikes, she swung between her platform and what was a trampoline-like wall covered in slime balloons. For every slime balloon Klum popped in 30 seconds, one more ton of slime was added to the vat. Kids voted online to determine exactly what type of spike pad Klum would use to pop the balloons. The choices were the hand-worn "mittens" and the winner the "butt pad" which unanimously beat out the mittens. Klum popped 7 balloons on the wall, adding 7 more tons of slime to the vat and bringing the total of slime in the vat to 27 tons.


2009
Will Ferrell
The comedian-actor slid down a slime-covered slide that was placed on top of Janss Steps on the UCLA campus, on a luge head first into a pool of slime.


2010
Apolo Anton Ohno
Two stunts were featured at the 2010 awards. First, eight-time Olympic medalist Ohno was catapulted into slime by sling shot with the help of WWE wrestler John Cena.


Jerry Trainor
Jackson Rathbone
Nicola Peltz
For the second stunt, to promote The Last Airbender stars Peltz and Rathbone along with iCarly star Trainor were featured in a bending-slime event. Since Peltz's character is a "water-bender", she bent the slime towards Trainor and Rathbone.


2011
Kelvin Ramer
Ramer's monster truck, rebodied and relivered for the event, jumps over a 50-foot Nickelodeon blimp award into a pool of slime. It was hosted by Paul "The Big Show" Wight who said that it was the most dangerous Kids' Choice slime stunt ever.[35]


2012
Big Show and The Miz
A slime themed wrestling match between Big Show and The Miz. When either The Big Show or The Miz hits the special cannons on each corner of the ring, slime shoots out and covers the audience. The Big Show defeated The Miz when he threw him over the ring and into a pool of slime. Afterwards, The Big Show was slimed for his ultimate reward.


2014
Dave England and Jukka Hilden
Kids got pick between 3 slime stunts and the one of the highest amount of votes would win. It was between Ultimate Slime Rodeo, High Speed Bathtub Race or a Slippery Obstacle Course, eventually the slime rodeo won. Both Dave and Jukka rode on Horses that were slime hoses and whoever held on the longest would win. Dave eventually held on the longest and won.
