OnCue was an online pay-TV service developed by Intel. In December 2013, Intel sought to sell the OnCue service. Verizon purchased the service for $200 million. Verizon repurposed the service for its Go90 internet video service. The Go90 service is estimated to launch in late July or early August 2015. [1]
