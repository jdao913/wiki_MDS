One America News Network (abbreviated as OANN), also referred to as One America News (abbreviated as OAN), is an American cable news television channel launched on July 4, 2013 that is owned by Herring Networks, Inc. The network is headquartered in San Diego, California, and operates a news bureau in Washington, D.C.[1] and New York City.
Originally launched with the intention of targeting a conservative and center-right audience,[2][3] OAN states a goal of delivering credible national and international news coverage throughout the day while its prime time political talk shows illustrate a conservative prospective.[4][5][6]
According to the Washington Post, the channel has risen to greater prominence due to its pro-Trump coverage.[7] Robert Herring, Sr., founder and CEO of the network, has ordered producers to promote certain types of content, such as pro-Trump stories, anti-Clinton stories and anti-abortion stories, and minimize stories about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.[7]

The original logo representation of the channel


The formation of the organization was announced on March 14, 2013 by Herring Networks, Inc., an independent and family-owned national video programming company owns and operates OAN and sister channel AWE (formerly WealthTV; the initialism being an acronym for "A Wealth of Entertainment"). When the network began in 2013 it had a limited partnership with The Washington Times.[1]
The network launched with the intention of targeting a conservative-leaning audience with OAN President Charles Herring telling CPAC that, “Fox News has done a great job serving the center-right and independent audiences...But those who consider themselves liberal have a half dozen or more choices on TV each day from which to get their news.”[8] Herring also stressed the network's separation of news and opinion content, with straight news reporting throughout the day and limited opinion commentary from evening talk shows, including The Daily Ledger hosted by Graham Ledger. Early advertisements for the channel touted the network's lack of commentary and focus on straight news reporting.[9] The channel was formally launched on July 4, 2013.
As of August 2017, One America News Network reached 35 million homes and had nationwide distribution from DirecTV, Verizon FiOS TV, AT&T U-verse, Frontier Communications, CenturyLink PRISM TV, and numerous regional video distributors.[10]
Early years
In July 2014, OAN relocated its news and production studios out of The Washington Times Building to its new location at 101 Constitution Avenue NW, near the United States Capitol. The move ended OAN's relationship with The Washington Times, which provided news and analysis,[11] as well as a lease space arrangement, for the network. While its Washington Bureau was previously located within the Times building, OAN remains solely owned and operated, including all editorial control, by Herring Networks, Inc.
In August 2014, OAN launched the show On Point with Tomi Lahren. Many clips of the program later went viral, and Lahren gained widespread attention for her commentaries in 2015. On August 19, 2015, Lahren completed her final show at OAN.[12][13] On the week of August 24, former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin guest hosted a program on the network.[14][15]
Reception
In March 2015, USC media professor Marty Kaplan praised the network for its focus on what he viewed as impartial news reporting, writing in The Huffington Post that, "Ten minutes of OAN tells me eight stories; 10 minutes of Fox or MSNBC tells me one story, to make me mad" while noting that its opinion segments were "as delusional and incendiary as anything on conservative talk radio or Fox."[16] Don Kaplan of the New York Daily News echoed similar sentiments, writing in December 2016 that, "it's by far one of the most fair news outlets around, serving up a daily diet of ad-free, non-ideological, nonstop news — without smirking, snarky anchors or much fanfare" while stating that its opinion segments "skew hard to the right."[17] The Washington Post's Marc Fisher considers the network "a reliably sympathetic voice of the [Trump] administration’s goals and actions".[18]
Trump presidency and access
The channel is known for its pro-Trump coverage.[7][19] According to a number of former and current employees at the channel, as well as internal e-mails, the executives of the channel have "directed his channel to push Trump’s candidacy, scuttle stories about police shootings, encourage antiabortion stories, minimize coverage of Russian aggression, and steer away from the new president’s troubles."[20] During the 2016 presidential campaign, the channel ran a special titled "Betrayal at Benghazi: The Cost of Hillary Clinton’s Dereliction and Greed."[20] Herring, the owner of the channel, sent producers at the channel a report falsely claiming that Hillary Clinton had a brain tumor, and asked them to check up on it.[20] He also shared a report with producers that claimed that Planned Parenthood had promoted abortion, and ordered them to minimize coverage of Pope Francis's US visit due to the Pope's calls for action on climate change.[20] Herring repeatedly ordered his producers not to cover stories pertaining to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.[20]
In October 2017, the channel said without any evidence that a "report" had been published which showed "U.K. Crime Rises 13% Annually Amid Spread of Radical Islamic Terror".[21] President Trump later repeated this falsehood, suggesting that he learned of from the OAN.[22][23]
In June 2017, One America News was granted a permanent seat in the White House's James Brady briefing room.[10] The network's Chief White House Correspondent, Trey Yingst, is one of the top five most called upon reporters covering the Trump administration.[24] One America News has been repeatedly called on by the President Trump during Presidential press conferences, including one in February 2017 when Yingst asked the President about his campaign's contacts with the Russian government.[25] Also in February 2017, One America News was invited to a network lunch with President Trump.[26] During an August 2017 press conference with the Finnish President, President Trump praised One America News stating, "...I want to congratulate you on the network. It's a great network." Amid compliments from the President of the United States, Herring stated that One America News considers itself a tough, but fair presence in the White House press corps.[27]
Roy Moore sexual misconduct report controversy
In November 2017, in the wake of a Washington Post report on accusations that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore had molested or made inappropriate sexual contact with a number of women under the age of 18 (including a 14-year old), One America News aired a segment citing a false rumor by an anonymous Twitter account that the Washington Post had offered $1,000 to Roy Moore's accusers.[28][29] One America News described the tweet as a "report" and described the tweeter as a "former Secret Service agent and Navy veteran".[29] The Twitter account had a history of tweeting falsehoods and conspiracy theories; the Twitter account has also made repeated and inconsistent lies about its identity, including appropriating the identity of a Navy serviceman who died in 2007.[29]
After it was revealed that the story was a hoax, One America News did not retract its report.[28]
