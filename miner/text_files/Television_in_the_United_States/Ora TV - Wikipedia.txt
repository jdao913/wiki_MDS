Ora TV is a television production studio and on-demand digital television network launched in 2012 by television host Larry King and funded by América Móvil, a business venture of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim.[1] Ora (which means "now" in Italian) both produces and distributes television shows including Emmy-nominated Larry King Now, Politicking with Larry King, Off the Grid with Jesse Ventura, Real Girl's Kitchen with Haylie Duff, and Brown Bag Wine Tasting with William Shatner.[2] Ora has production offices and studios in New York City and Los Angeles.
History[edit]
Ora TV was founded by Larry King and Carlos Slim in 2012 as an outlet to produce a new show for Larry King after leaving CNN.[3] Larry King Now was launched as Ora's first show in July 2012 and aired both on Ora TV and Hulu. In 2014, Larry King Now episode "Head Trauma in the NFL" was nominated for a News and Documentary Emmy Award in the Outstanding News Discussion and Analysis category.[4]
In April 2013, Ora TV acquired Stick Figure Studios, an Emmy award-winning documentary and reality series production company based in New York. Stick Figure is the producer of Catching Hell, a spearfishing docu-drama that aired on The Weather Channel in the summer of 2014, with exclusive digital content on Ora TV.[5]
Ora TV's other content includes Haylie Duff's Real Girl's Kitchen food & lifestyle series that aired on both Ora TV and the Cooking Channel,[6] the Laugh Factory video archive,[7] and road trip adventure show Wayward Nation, which launched in September 2014.
On June 30, 2015, Ora TV severed ties with American real estate tycoon Donald Trump. Arturo Elías Ayub, Slim’s son-in-law and chairman of Ora TV, called his remarks about undocumented immigrants racist and an insult.[8]
An Episode of Politicking which aired on September 8, 2016 and featured 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump was the spark of a controversy.[9][10][11] Numerous media outlets reported the interview was done by Russian state owned, 'Kremlin-backed' television. Ora TV released a statement clarifying that the content is licensed to RT America but produced independently from the network.[12]
