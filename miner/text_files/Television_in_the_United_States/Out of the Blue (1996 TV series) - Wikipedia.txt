Out of the Blue is an American teen sitcom that ran in syndication from September 1995 to February 1996. The series was filmed on location at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, and distributed by Tribune Entertainment. It is notable in that each of its twenty two episodes was filmed in both Spanish and English simultaneously and starred a predominately Hispanic cast of several different nationalities.
The show was dubbed into German as Sommer Sonne Florida, and into Italian as Un salto nel blu, but was poorly distributed and largely unknown in Germany, Italy, the United States, or Latin America.
Among the show's young cast was Spanish fashion model Veronica Blume, whose budding real-life modeling career was occasionally incorporated into the show's storyline, and Paulo Benedeti, who would later play recurring roles on American soap operas.
