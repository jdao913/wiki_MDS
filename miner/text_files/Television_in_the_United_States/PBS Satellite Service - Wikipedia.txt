PBS Satellite Service or "HD01" (formerly PBS Schedule X in Eastern Time, with the west coast delay signal designated PBS-XD) is the 24-hour network feed from the PBS that provides a mixed variety of programming selected from PBS's regular network service. In the X/XD years was multicast by some PBS member stations on an over-the-air DTV subchannel along with their regular programming, or during overnight hours on their main channel to provide a second opportunity for viewers to watch or record primetime programming.
As of 2015, the PBS Satellite Service can be received unscrambled via satellite on these coordinates:

PBS-HD01 on the AMC-21 satellite (at 125°W), on: Ku-band transponder 22 (12140 MHz, vertical polarity, DVB, unencrypted.
The defunct PBS-X (east/west, with the western feed tagged "XD") and other secondary PBS services (such as PBS Kids (in standard definition) are or had been also on the AMC-21 satellite as Ku-band transponder 24 (12180 MHz, vertical polarity), unencrypted.

Scheduling[edit]
PBS Satellite Service is freely and nationally available from AMC-21 at 125°W using free-to-air satellite dishes as small as three feet, and is also offered by U.S. direct broadcast satellite providers to subscribers who lack a local PBS feed.
PBS Satellite Service provides two free national feeds in each format, one scheduled for the Eastern U.S., the other, PBS-XD, on a three-hour delay to fit timezone differences for the West Coast. These services have been succeeded by the 1080i high-definition digital feeds PBS HD01 and HD02.
