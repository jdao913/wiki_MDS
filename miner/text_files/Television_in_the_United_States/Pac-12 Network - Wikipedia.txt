Overview[edit]
Announced on July 27, 2011 and launched on August 15, 2012, the national network was available to at least 48 million pay television households in the United States at the time of its debut,[2] while the regional networks are available in all providers within their respective Pac-12 regional territory.[3] It is the third sports network to be devoted to a specific collegiate athletic conference (after the Big Ten Network and the now-defunct MountainWest Sports Network) and the first to be owned by a conference outright without support from outside companies (Fox Entertainment Group owns 49% of Big Ten Network, while MountainWest Sports Network had CBS and Comcast as partners, and SEC Network is wholly owned by ESPN).
The networks feature 24-hour coverage of Pac-12 sanctioned sporting events, including olympic sports as well as broadcasts of archived sports telecasts. The contract ensures that every football and men's basketball game is televised nationally.[4] Sports not featured on the national Pac-12 Network are instead carried through the regional networks as well as on the Pac-12 Digital Network, which was launched the same day.
On June 10, 2012, the Pac-12 Conference announced a partnership with pay-per-view service In Demand and Comcast Media Center (CMC) that would provide the networks with technical support, video on demand services, and support for TV Everywhere services. The infrastructure of the Pac-12 Networks, 12 member institutions and CMC's operations in Denver, Colorado are connected via fiber network. Master control origination services, including compression and satellite front-haul services, satellite receiver authorizations, and disaster recovery are also run through the CMC in Denver.[5] The following month on July 22, the Pac-12 Conference announced an additional partnership with In Demand that would provide mobile production facilities and below-the-line crews for all 12 schools in the conference.[6]
Programming[edit]
The Pac-12 Networks produce telecasts of roughly 850 collegiate events each year (350 events on Pac-12's national network, and 500 events carried on Pac-12 regional networks).[1] The national network includes 35 football games, 100 men's basketball games and 40 women's basketball games on an annual basis. The Pac-12 national network also features all spring football games, coaches shows, and news conferences. The Pac-12 network has also shown rugby matches played by schools from the PAC Rugby Conference, even though college rugby is not a sport sanctioned by the NCAA.[7]
Original programs broadcast by the networks include:

Pac-12 Sports Report - A weekly studio show discussing and highlighting the Pac-12 events of the week
Pac-12 Football Weekly - A weekly studio show breaking down the latest football news from around the Pac-12
The Drive - A weekly docu-series that provides a behind-the-scenes look inside Pac-12 football and men's basketball programs with exclusive content and audio from players and staff[8]
Pac-12 Classics - A replay of classic Pac-12 games and events which includes commentary from the players and coaches involved
Pac-12 Encore - A replay of recent Pac-12 games or events
Pac-12 Playbook - A weekly football coaches show[9]
The 12 Best - A series that counts down the top 12 conference sports moments within various categories
Varsity Days - A program featuring rare or never-before-seen footage of Pac-12 athletes and coaches, recapping historic moments and unforgettable battles
Timelines - A 12-installment series chronicling the great sports moments from the previous year for each Pac-12 school
Conference of Champions - A non-sports program that profiles current students in various features exploring how the university and educational experience fuels personal aspirations and future career endeavors. Presidents, chancellors, and professors supply additional context, providing viewers a unique and poignant look at the rich history, culture, and traditions of each Pac-12 university.

Carriage[edit]
The original announcement of the Pac-12 Networks' launch on July 27, 2011 included the announcement of carriage agreements with four major cable providers, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications and Bright House Networks to carry the Pac-12 Network and Pac-12 Digital Network at launch. The agreements did not guarantee that the Pac-12 Networks would be available in all areas within the territory of a Pac-12 university, and a minimum of 40 million homes nationally at launch date.[10] The agreements complimented a 12-year deal that the Pac-12 Conference had struck with Fox Sports and ESPN that began in 2012. In addition, the network entered into extended negotiations with satellite providers. Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott stated in a May 8, 2012 interview with sports radio station KJR in Seattle that he is "quietly optimistic" that deals with providers would be made in time for the channel's planned fall 2012 launch. As of September 7, 2013, the Pac-12 Network has not yet signed carriage deals with DirecTV, Charter Communications and Verizon FiOS.
On July 20, 2012, the Pac-12 Conference announced a long-term agreement with the National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC), a cooperative of 900 mostly smaller and rural cable providers, allowing any member of the NCTC access to carry one or more of the Pac-12 Network as well as providing access to the Pac-12 Digital Network through the NCTC WTVE TV Everywhere platform.[11] In an August 10, 2012 conference, the conference announced that NCTC members Strata Networks and All West Communications in Utah, San Bruno Cable in the San Francisco Bay Area, GCI in Alaska, LocalTel Communications in Wenatchee, WA and Ashland Communications in Oregon had agreed to carry the Pac-12 Network.[12] On July 28, 2012, Frontier Communications announced on one of its official Facebook accounts that the company would carry the channel on Frontier FiOS TV.[13] The deal was officially announced on August 1, 2012.
Several smaller providers reached carriage agreements with the network during the month of August 2012. On August 1, Oregon-based cable providers BendBroadband announced an intention to carry the Pac-12 Network as well as the Pac-12 Digital Network on their "bendbroadband2go" TV Everywhere platform.[14] Two days later on August 3, 2012, Arizona-based Western Broadband and Orbitel Communications announced their intent to carry the Pac-12 Arizona Network.[15] On August 6, Astound Broadband announced an intention to carry the Pac-12 Bay Area Network.[16] A day later on August 7, Wave Broadband announced an intention to carry the Pac-12 Bay Area, Oregon, and Washington Networks.[17] On August 8, 2012, CC Communications announced its intent to carry the Pac-12 National Network and one Pac-12 regional channel (on August 30, 2012, CC Communications began carrying the Pac-12 Mountain network, in addition to the national network).[18] Click! Network also revealed on their official Facebook page that it would carry the Pac-12 Network.[19] On August 21, 2012, Canby Telecom announced an intention to carry the Pac-12 National Network as well as all Pac-12 regional networks.[20]
On September 8, 2012, Dish Network announced that it would carry the Pac-12 National Network starting on September 8. To date, it is the only satellite carrier to have struck a carriage agreement with the Pac-12 Networks, and was the largest pay television provider to reach a carriage deal during 2012, bringing the Pac-12 Networks' national coverage to approximately 60 million households.[21] On February 1, 2016, however, Pac-12 restricted access to the regional channels for DISH subscribers.[22] On October 10, 2012, the conference came to an agreement with Consolidated Communications for its SureWest Communications system in Northern California to carry the Pac-12 Networks Bay Area regional service.[23] On September 6, 2013, Pac-12 Networks entered into a deal with AT&T U-verse to carry the main feed on channel 759 (as well as on channel 760 in the San Francisco Bay Area, and on channel 761 in Los Angeles).[24]
As of 2015, the Pac-12 Networks were "available in" 90 million homes, but about 12 million actually subscribed to the network, according to SNL Kagan.[25] On February 10, 2016, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on behalf of Jessop & Proulx LLP, added Pac-12 Network to its list of foreign broadcasters that are allowed to be carried by Canadian pay television providers.[26] By the end of 2016, Pac-12 Network had carriage deals with Charter Communications in Los Angeles and Dallas,[27] Frontier FiOS,[28] and streaming service Sling TV,[29] but still had not come to terms with DirecTV.[30] In August 2017, the Pac-12 Networks were added to FuboTV.[31]

On June 8, 2012, Pac-12 Enterprises announced a partnership with Ooyala to develop the Pac-12 Digital Network, branded as Pac-12 Now,[34] which serves as the TV Everywhere platform for the Pac-12 Network. Pac-12 Now is available through web browsers, mobile and iOS devices, with content accessible via a login through a pay television provider.[2] The Pac-12 Digital Network broadcasts 800 live sporting events, including Olympic sports, 30 football games and 130 men's basketball games annually. Video on demand content, including recent and classic events, are also available on the service.[35]

In June 2016, Pac-12 Enterprises announced that social network Twitter will broadcast least 150 live games in the 2016-2017 season under the brand Pac-12 Plus. The service will not feature college football or basketball, but less prominent sports like soccer, baseball, softball, ice hockey, gymnastics, swimming and track and field.[36]
Strike[edit]
On December 8, 2012, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) declared a strike against the network, citing the hiring of non-union television crews at lower wages at many of the twelve campus sites.[37][38] The strike ended 10 days later.[39]
