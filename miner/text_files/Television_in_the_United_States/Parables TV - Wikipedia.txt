Business model[edit]
Parables TV primarily operates through three distribution channels:

Subscription video on demand service on its website and mobile devices similar to Netflix.
Subscription streaming 24-hour-per-day linear TV channel viewable on its website and mobile devices.
Program syndicator for other religious TV networks. (Parables TV offers a syndicated “movie of the week” that airs on other Christian TV networks)

Parables TV has entered the online TV market with a video on demand library that includes hundreds of Christian movies, documentaries and TV series not available on many cable and satellite TV channels, including international Christian TV networks.[8] Parable's marketing has also aligned with many churches of various denominations. In exchange, Parables TV sponsors church events using media avenues such as local radio, and provides free screenings of new movies.[9] Expansion plans include creating original Christian movies and original scripted TV series; distribution to other “TV everywhere” platforms like Truli TV,[10] including smart televisions and gaming devices; syndication with other faith networks; and strategic partnerships with filmmakers.[11] According to MediaPost Communications, online TV viewing is up 246%,[12] and within five years streaming video on demand will pass regular TV in the number of viewers. Parables is promoted on YouTube, and GodTube with endorsements from celebrities like Robert Duvall, Diane Lane, John Schneider, Leonard Maltin, Morgan Freeman and Alex Kendrick.[13] According to Business Insider, Christian themed movies have been so profitable that Hollywood continues to target a religious demographic in theaters with films such as The Bible (miniseries), Noah (2014 film), God's Not Dead, Transcendence, Heaven is for Real and The Passion of the Christ.[14]
