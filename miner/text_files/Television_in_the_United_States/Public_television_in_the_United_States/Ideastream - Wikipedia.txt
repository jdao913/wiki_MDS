Ideastream (stylized and marketed as lowercase ideastream) is a non-profit organization that owns and operates the major public broadcasting stations in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. The company is the owner and licensee of PBS member WVIZ, NPR member WCPN, and classical music station WCLV 104.9 FM.[1]
The planning committees of WVIZ and WCPN held several meetings in 1999 to discuss partnering in order to serve the Northeast Ohio community. The two stations soon concluded they had so much in common that a merger was the best option.
The merger terms were approved by the boards of Educational Television Association of Metropolitan Cleveland (owner of WVIZ) and Cleveland Public Radio (owner of WCPN) in October 2000, and Ideastream was officially formed in July 2001.
The two stations have since become very close sister stations to each other and share a facility at the Idea Center in Playhouse Square in downtown Cleveland.[2] WCLV was added to the group in 2012; it had moved its studios to the Idea Center in 2010.
