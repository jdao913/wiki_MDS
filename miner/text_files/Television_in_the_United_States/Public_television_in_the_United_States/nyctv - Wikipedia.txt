NYCTV (sometimes branded in lowercase text as nyctv) is a group of government-owned broadcast and cable TV channels operated by NYC Media Group, a division of the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications.[1] NYC TV is considered to be the catalyst behind the trend in hyperlocal content production and news across local broadcasters in the United States.
Its main over-the-air broadcast channel, WNYE-TV (channel 25), reaches the New York City metropolitan area, which includes Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Suffolk and Westchester counties in New York state as well as portions of New Jersey and Connecticut. WNYE-TV is carried on all area cable and satellite systems. NYC TV's main broadcast signal, WNYE-TV, reaches 7.43 million households (approximately 20 million people) in the New York City market, thus making NYC TV the fifth largest local television station in the United States.[2] The main broadcast station is seen in the New York City area on channel 25 on all cable and satellite systems with the exception of Cablevision, where it is seen on channel 22.
NYC TV is also the name given to five additional cable channels that air on Time Warner, Cablevision, Verizon Fios and RCN systems in the five boroughs of New York City.[3] The station has recently begun operating several digital multicast sub-channels, also known as DTV channels. NYC-DT1 is a clone of the analog channel, NYC-DT2 is a clone of its cable only traffic and weather channel known "City Drive Live" and NYC-DT3, also being branded as NYCTV-HD, is expected to launch in May, 2009, and will be an all High-Definition version of the primary analog channel.
NYCTV has been recognized with 160 New York Emmy nominations and 42 New York Emmy Awards.[4]

History[edit]
In 2003, co-founders Seth Unger and Arick Wierson - both aides to Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg - launched NYC-TV, which replaced "Crosswalks Television," the name of the previous network.[5][6]
In 2005, NYC TV expanded when it acquired WNYE-TV along with the radio station WNYE-FM. The new group was called NYC Media Group. The local cable channels programmed by NYC TV provide coverage of a diverse array of programming formats ranging from horse-racing (off-track betting) on channel 71, local politics and government news on channel 74, traffic and weather on channel 72 and 93, and ethnic/international programming on channel 73.
NYC TV has received attention as an innovator in municipal broadcasting. Since its inception, NYC TV has been nominated for 160 New York Emmy Awards, winning 42.[7] It has also won 42 Telly Awards and 4 Promax Awards and was recently nominated for 4 Webby Awards.[8] Cities such as Seoul, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, and Los Angeles have expressed interest in replicating the station's success.
On September 24, 2007 Mayor Bloomberg held a press conference[8] to introduce NYC TV On Demand, a partnership with online video platform Brightcove to offer on demand programming online.[9]
Ratings[edit]
The once-overlooked station has soared in the ratings with an average 150,000 viewers for its most popular shows, making it one of the most-watched local stations in the New York market. Its success in attracting viewers is largely viewed as having translated into commercial success. NYC TV now has a wide range of sponsors and underwriters supporting the station's shows. Companies such as Subaru, American Express, Delta and Snapple, as well as many local establishments, have been active in underwriting NYC TV programs.
In 2006, NYC TV became the first public broadcaster in the United States to enter into a deal with a major private broadcast network, NBC, to air its shows.[8] NYC TV aired weekdays on WNBC and on digital channel 4.4 / 28.4. Selected programs air in prime time on WNYE-TV, a public television station in New York City. Continental, Delta, and South African airlines have featured NYCTV on their flights. Carnival Cruiselines launched an NYC TV close-circuit channel on its New York-bound cruise lines in 2006. In that same year, NYC TV programming became available for purchase on DVD.
Programming[edit]
NYC TV programming on its flagship channel 25 is focused principally on actuality formats such as lifestyle, documentary and reality entertainment. The show formats range from shows like Globe Trekker, VideoFashion News, and Endless Feast, to NYC TV original programs such as Eat Out NY, New York 360*, and Cool in Your Code as well as the nationally syndicated show, Secrets of New York. Other popular programs, like New York Noise and The Bridge focus on the city's music scene. New York Noise has a loyal following among musicians. Tommy Ramone was the host of an episode and the show has featured such bands as Fischerspooner, Animal Collective, Cat Power and the National. Well known Indie and electronica stars such as Moby are known to pop in for surprise appearances and performances. Artists like Beirut and groups such as Vampire Weekend and the Plain White T's openly credit their big break to the show and its producer, Shirley Braha. The show is filmed around the city, from longtime clubs like Irving Plaza to the accordion shop Main Squeeze.
Below is a list of some of the original series on NYCTV:

$9.99: a guide to free and cheap attractions.
Blueprint NYC: tours of New York's iconic locations (the Brooklyn Bridge, City Hall, Central Park).
Backdrop NYC: focuses on short films shot in and set in New York City. The host interviews filmmakers about the challenges of making their documentaries, animations, or films in the city.
Cool In Your Code: suggestions on places for people to meet and things to do in the city's 200-plus ZIP codes.
Eat Out NY: an insider's guide to popular places to eat, as well as interviews with chefs.
Healthy Soul with Gina Keatley: takes you to some unlikely locations on ingredient hunts and explores the "soul" of different foods before facing the challenge to recreate the menu with All of the Passion, None of the Pounds.
It's My Park: highlights the features of New York City's 28,000 acres (110 km²) of parkland. www.nyc.gov/parks/video
NYC 360: takes viewers through trends in music, fashion, advertising, and blogging.
NYC Paradetown USA: features the city's many parades.
Secrets of New York: the host explores the city's sewers, subway tunnels, and history, teaching viewers about infrastructure and neighborhood history.
The Bridge: chronicles hip-hop's early days (hip-hop began in New York City). Each episode features vintage video of the New York scene.

Criticisms[edit]
Since the relaunch of the station, the station's popularity has been reflected in ratings, advertiser support, and press coverage. Despite these successes, the station has come under some degree of criticism from the New York City City Council, and Councilmember Gale Brewer who has called NYC TV "too hip and flashy." Although Brewer's rhetoric has subsided since former General Manager Arick Wierson huddled with Deputy Mayor Ed Skyler and agreed to produce a new news program entitled "City Scoop," Brewer still contends that NYC TV has strayed from its original mission in search of audience share and advertising dollars.[10] On August 4, 2009, the Village Voice published a cover article criticizing the network's founder, Arick Wierson, for his many outside business interests, and his close relationship to the Mayor and other wealthy businessmen.[11]
