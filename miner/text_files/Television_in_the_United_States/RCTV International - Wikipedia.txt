RCTV International shares a legacy of more than 50 years of history with RCTV Venezuela, its mother company and one of the first commercial television stations in South America. Entrepreneur William H. Phelps, who had also established Venezuela's first commercial radio station, Radio Caracas Radio, launched Radio Caracas Television (RCTV Venezuela) on November 15, 1953 in Caracas.
Always the leader, RCTV is noted for its talent" the best hosts, the best news anchors, great actors and the most beautiful models. Their original and canned programming became part of the Venezuelan's everyday life, and many named their children after the channel's stars.
RCTV moved to cable in 2007 after the Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez refused to renew its terrestrial licence.In 2010, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez had taken six cable television channels off the air, including RCTV International, for breaking a law on transmitting government material.The government had urged cable services to drop channels ignoring the rules.[1]

Vocation[edit]
RCTV has always been enthusiastic in the pursuit of its goals and invests accordingly in the technologies that best serve its standard high quality. Shortly after its launch, with a modern transmitter and microwave relay system, the station expanded its signal from Caracas to the rest of the country. It was also the first station to expand the programming schedule, limited until then to the evening hours, by starting at noon first and soon in the morning. In 1961 RCTV established their Video Tape Department and began color production by mid-1970s, although it was only in 1981 that the government finally authorized color broadcasts.
Telenovelas[edit]
RCTV strongly fostered original production and by then had extended its production facilities to 2,500 m2, with telenovelas at the top of the list. Telenovelas generated the most unbelievable examples of audience loyalty, attracting new creatives and prompting new production techniques, new story lines with social, political and even comic twists. Among RCTV's main assets are its scripts, its stories, always successful with the audience. Today, it owns one of the most important archives in the continent.
Expansion[edit]
RCTV always had exporting in mind. Amid fierce competition with Mexican, Brazilian and Argentinean product, the company began to explore markets beyond their borders, markets that were about to explode. When RCTV identified a favorable outlook for their products, Coral Pictures was established as the company's international distributor in Miami, Florida in 1982.
By mid-1980s RCTV already reported sales revenue from foreign markets. Also, 'collateral benefits' were recorded, such as the preference in other Spanish-speaking countries for the Venezuelan accent in dubbed programming, as well as extraordinary event occurring with telenovela audiences in countries as diverse as Turkey, Croatia and Israel. Likewise, RCTV is marveled by the fact that their products are present in more than 48 countries in the English, Portuguese, French, Hebrew, German, Mandarin, Cantonese, Thai, Japanese, Italian, Greek and Turkish languages. Titles such as Cristal, Topacio, Leonela, La Fiera, Estefanía, La Dama de Rosa, Señora, El Desprecio, Kassandra, Dulce Ilusión, Eva Marina, and adventure travel series Expedition toured the world.
Globalization[edit]
After more than twenty-five years in the field, Coral Pictures is mature and fruitful. Its team, satisfied, turns towards the mother company in 2005 to honor it by taking the name RCTV International. They return to the mother fully developed, with capacity to interpret their markets, knowing their clients needs, and able to translate that knowledge into service opportunities. They have learned "to see with the eyes of the local programmer" in each market.
Supported by half a century of family history and more than a quarter century of its own, RCTV International offers a range of product that includes those of other prestigious producers in the region. They have also extended their reach by adding formats and co-productions to this offer. They have added cable and satellite to their client mix and pursue new challenges and opportunities that will strengthen and consolidate their global aim in this era of digital communications that has just begun.
