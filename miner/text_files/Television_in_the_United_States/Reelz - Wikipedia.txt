Reelz (also known as REELZCHANNEL) is an American digital cable and satellite television network that is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting. The network's programming was formerly devoted to entertainment-oriented programming focusing on the Hollywood film and entertainment industry, with programs featuring information on theatrical film releases as well as information on movies released on DVD and airing on cable television. Currently, outside a few entertainment programs, repeats of the Oxygen series Snapped, and some reality series and films, the network mainly airs original and acquired films, series, and documentaries about celebrity scandals.
As of February 2015, Reelz is available to approximately 68.2 million pay television households (58.6% of households with at least one television set) in the United States.[1]

Overview[edit]




Previous Reelz logo as ReelzChannel (2006–2012)


The network launched on September 27, 2006 as ReelzChannel,[2] initially available on satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network. The network originally maintained a programming focus similar to the original format of E! (and its predecessor MovieTime), focusing on programs about the entertainment industry including movie review and junket interview series. The network eventually signed carriage agreements with various cable providers including Time Warner Cable, Comcast, Charter Communications and Cablevision.
In early 2009, ReelzChannel moved its operations from Los Angeles, California, to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Hubbard owns that city's NBC-affiliated television station KOB.[3] At that point, the network shifted its programming focus to incorporate acquired series alongside its entertainment news programs. In August 2011, ReelzChannel debuted its first miniseries, The Kennedys. An unauthorized biopic centering on President John F. Kennedy, Jackie Kennedy and the Camelot empire,[4] ReelzChannel acquired the rights to the film after it was passed by History. In November 2012, the network shortened its name to simply Reelz.
Programming[edit]
Besides running entertainment industry-related programs, Reelz also carries acquired programming, including reality series. The network also formerly ran segments twice each hour called REELZ Recommends, which highlighted programs available via video on demand services (such as Netflix) and premium cable networks (such as HBO, Showtime and Starz). Those programs were tailored to providers based on either the pay-per-view channel map or VOD remote instructions for each system.
