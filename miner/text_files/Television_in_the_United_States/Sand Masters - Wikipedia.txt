Premise[edit]
"A team of six talented sand sculptors travel all over the world to create unimaginable, massive masterpieces made from sand. These "Sand Masters" design colossal works of art while battling seemingly insurmountable challenges—unpredictable weather, wildly ambitious designs and overly demanding business clients."
The series intro is narrated by Rusty Croft. The first series intro, set to Mr. Sandman:


“
My name is Rusty and I love playing in the sand, but it didn't exactly pay the bills. So I teamed up with my best friend Kirk and started a new business. We recruited some of the best sculptors we know. Now we travel all over the world to work on the craziest jobs and we turn ordinary sand into masterpieces.
”


Second season intro:


“
My name is Rusty Croft. I carved out an unusual career. I'm a sand sculptor. I've got the best team of artists in the business. We travel the world. Collect crazy clients. And create mind-blowing masterpieces. If you can dream it, we can make it out of sand.
”
