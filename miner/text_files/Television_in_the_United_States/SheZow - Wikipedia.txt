SheZow is an Australian-Canadian animated superhero comedy television series. It features the adventures of a boy who inadvertently inherits the role of a superheroine, which imposes an explicit feminine theme to his costumed appearance and equipment.

Synopsis[edit]
The series' protagonist, a 12-year-old boy named Guy Hamdon,[3] discovers the superheroine SheZow's ring of power inherited from his late Aunt Agnes; then subsequently transforms into a female costumed crime-fighter by uttering the phrase "You Go Girl!".[4]
While the power ring does grant him superpowers, it was only meant to be worn by a girl, so Guy must wear a female superhero costume while fighting crime.

Development and production[edit]
The concept was originally created by Obie Scott Wade as a short film for Disney Channel's Shorty McShorts' Shorts in 2007.
In a 2013 interview, Wade stated that the inspiration for SheZow was based on his experiences of watching Saturday-morning cartoons and a general love for superheroes. "When I was a kid I watched a show on Saturday mornings called Shazam! ... it was Shazam and Isis and I just thought it would be interesting to see what would happen if he accidentally said 'SHE-zam,' would he get a different costume or become a different hero?" He added that a lot of the facets to SheZow's mythology came about from the women writers on his team. "I asked the women on my team ... what would be a good weakness for a woman superhero and they all said, 'Bad hair!' ... A lot of the gadgets and jokes [for 'SheZow'] came from women."[2]
Broadcast[edit]
In the United States, it was added to the schedule lineup of Hub Network (now Discovery Family) on 1 June 2013.[5] In the United Kingdom, the series was on Kix in 2016.[6] It is shown on Eleven and ABC3 in Australia. Series 1 was available on Netflix from 2015 to 2017 [7][8] It was later aired on Discovery Family from 22 November to 27 December 2015.
Reception[edit]
The show was considered controversial by several Christian groups for using cross-dressing and transvestism as a source of humour,[9] with One Million Moms, an affiliate of the American Family Association being one of the groups targeting it.[10] In response, series creator Obie Scott Wade stated, "SheZow is not transgendered. He's a boy, his gender never changes, he's just trapped in a silly costume." He also added that he doesn't find it child-inappropriate at all, because the idea came to him in his youth.[2]
