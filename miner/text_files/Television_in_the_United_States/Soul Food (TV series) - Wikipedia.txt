Premise[edit]
Soul Food follows the triumphs, struggles, and rivalries of the Josephs, a tight-knit African American family living in Chicago, Illinois. The series picks up six months after the events in the 1997 film, as the family tries to hold together after the death of the Joseph sisters' mother Josephine (Irma P. Hall, reprising her role in flashback sequences), usually referred to as Mama, Mother Joe, or Big Mama.

Response[edit]
Soul Food was one of the first long-running and successful dramatic series on television to feature a predominantly African-American cast. Short-lived series such as Under One Roof and City of Angels featured predominantly black casts but never gained recognition due to lack of ratings and viewership. The show tackled topics of politics, homosexuality, racial discrimination, and certain forms of abuse (drug, domestic, and sexual). Because it aired on Showtime, there was use of mild profanity and partial nudity. Certain episodes even served as launching pads for up-and-coming new musical artists. Many known performers such as Gerald Levert, Montell Jordan, India.Arie, Sunshine Anderson and Common have made appearances as well.
Popularity[edit]
The show received five NAACP Image Awards nominations for Outstanding Drama Series and won three consecutive times in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Also, a three-book series was launched in 2002. The show received a record-breaking renewal of 40 episodes in 2001[citation needed]
The Soul Food cast was interviewed by comedian Mo'Nique about fan reaction to the series. The cast explained that fans of the show would approach them at various places, including the airport, and would talk to them about story lines that they enjoyed or disliked. Nicole Ari Parker commented on studio executives telling the cast and crew that they were not marketable overseas; yet, after the show ended, the series gained a fan base in France.
Syndication[edit]
In 2004, Black Entertainment Television (BET) acquired the rights to air reruns of the series (in the United States). The episodes have been edited to allow for commercials, and to meet FCC content standards for basic cable networks. BET aired syndicated reruns of Soul Food for several years, until it shifted the series to its sister network, BET J (now known as Centric). On March 15, 2010, the principal cast members (excluding Rockmond Dunbar), appeared together on the BET late-night talk show The Mo'Nique Show. TV One began airing reruns of the series in January 2012. Syndication rights are currently held by Aspire, which began airing reruns of the series in January 2016.
Home releases[edit]
On June 24, 2003, Paramount Home Entertainment released the first season of Soul Food on DVD, just two weeks after the series wrapped its fourth season. After a long delay, the remaining four seasons were released in 2007 and 2008 by Paramount and CBS Home Entertainment. While season one (billed as "the complete first season") runs in its unedited form, seasons two through four do not, primarily due to musical licensing issues.
International rights to the series are held by Fox, which has yet to release DVD sets in other territories.
