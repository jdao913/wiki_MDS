Production background[edit]
The series aired on New York City television station WABD, which at the time was the flagship station for the DuMont Television Network. The series is notable not just as an early example of sports-themed television programming, but for having a surviving episode from 1948 (see below).
The series featured Joan Arliss (per Paley Center for Media) or Joan Kerwin (per Billboard magazine) and Chuck Tranum. Tranum is also known for having hosted Manhattan Spotlight.[1]
Billboard magazine (see below) listed the sponsor as Transmirra Image Refiner, and the producer as being Bob Loewi.
Reception[edit]
The 22 November 1947 edition of Billboard gave the series a mixed review. A writer for the magazine said "As a low-budget live production, the concept behind the show is a fresh one which should provide interesting and relaxing diversion for home viewers - the kind of program badly needed by video. Execution, however, falls somewhat short of concept, altho it has improved considerably in recent weeks".[2]
Episode status[edit]
A single episode of this series is held by the Paley Center for Media, listed as having aired August 29, 1948.[3]
