Synopsis[edit]
Against a backdrop of the ballet world in the 1960s and 1970s, this feature-length documentary traces the life and times of dancer/photographer Steven Caras. Despite bullying at school and parental rejection at home, Caras pursued his dream of becoming a dancer and was invited by George Balanchine to join the New York City Ballet. Balanchine also took note of Caras's talent as a photographer and granted him privileged access to photograph all aspects of City Ballet's private world. Ultimately, Caras created over 100,000 images including "Last Bow" depicting Balanchine's final curtain call.
Interviews[edit]
Dancers and choreographers interviewed include Peter Martins, Jacques D'Amboise, Mia Michaels, Allegra Kent, Patricia McBride, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, Sean Lavery, Elizabeth Streb, Virginia Johnson, and Gary Chryst. Comments on the historical importance of Caras' photographs are provided by Terry Teachout, Sara Morthland, and Jacqueline Davis.
