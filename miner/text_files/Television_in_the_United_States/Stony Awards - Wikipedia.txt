The High Times Stony Awards (a.k.a. the Stonys), sponsored by High Times magazine, celebrate the "highest and stoniest" movies and TV shows of the year. The High Times Stonys began as an annual article in High Times magazine conceived by Senior Editor Steve Bloom. Editor-in-Chief Steven Hager then suggested they hold an event in New York and invite the public to attend. Three High Times Stony Awards were held in New York City. In 2007, the High Times Stonys were moved to Los Angeles. Occasionally, the Stonys appears only as an article in High Times, but most years the event is staged. In 2010, Special Stony Achievement Awards were presented to the documentary film What if Cannabis Cured Cancer by Len Richmond, truTV's Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura, as well as a posthumous award to Jack Herer, which was accepted by his son, Dan Herer.
Award winners receive a bong-shaped trophy.[1]
