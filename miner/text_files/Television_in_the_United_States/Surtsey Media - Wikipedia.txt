History[edit]
Surtsey was formed in 1996 to own television stations. Its stations, KVCT in Victoria, Texas and KFJX in Pittsburg, Kansas, were both operated by Saga Communications under time brokerage agreements.
On May 10, 2017, the company announced that it would acquire Saga Communications' television clusters in Joplin, Missouri and Victoria, Texas. The Surtsey stations' license assets will be acquired by SagamoreHill Broadcasting.[1] The sale closed on September 1, 2017.
