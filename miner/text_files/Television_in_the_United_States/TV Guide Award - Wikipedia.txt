1950s[edit]
Ellery Queen won a TV Guide Award in 1950 for Best Mystery Show on Television.[1] The Lucky Strike ads of the early 1950s won the first TV Guide award as commercial of the year. The trophy was a bronze statuette of a heroic figure holding a filigree globe.[2] The 1952 TV Guide Magazine award was given to Zoo Parade, which also won the 1950 George Foster Peabody Award and the 1951 Look TV Award.[3] American Bandstand was featured on its second anniversary in the Philadelphia issue of TV Guide, which said it was "the people's choice" for a 1954 TV Guide award. The magazine had been founded the year before by Walter Annenberg, owner of American Bandstand.[4]
