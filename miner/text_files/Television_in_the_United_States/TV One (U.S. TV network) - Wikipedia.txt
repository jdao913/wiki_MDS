TV One (stylized as TV ONΞ) is an American digital cable and satellite television network that is owned by Urban One (formerly Radio One until May 8, 2017), having acquired Comcast's stake in the TV network in 2015.[2][3] Headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, TV One's programming targets African American adults with a broad mix of original lifestyle and entertainment-oriented series, documentaries, movies, concert performances and reruns of sitcoms from the 1970s through the 2000s.
As of February 2015, TV One is available to approximately 57 million pay television households (48.9% of households with at least one television set) in the United States.[4]

TV One launched on January 19, 2004, on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, as a competitor to the longer-established Black Entertainment Television.[5] At the time of its launch, the channel was in approximately 2.2 million homes in 16 markets.[5] On July 7, 2008, the network's president and CEO Johnathan Rodgers announced that TV One would provide extensive coverage of the Democratic National Convention that August.[6] In 2011, TV One's original co-owner Comcast acquired NBCUniversal, effectively integrating TV One and the other Comcast Entertainment Group channels into NBCUniversal's portfolio.[7]
In August 2012, TV One updated its on-air look and logo, as part of a plan to "tell stories about how African-American life unfolds and to distinguish it from a growing number of competitors."[8] On July 9, 2013, TV One announced that it would debut its first live one-hour, weekday morning news program that would be hosted by journalist Roland S. Martin.[9] The program, News One Now, premiered on November 4, 2013.[10]
In December 2014, Brad Siegel was hired as president of TV One. Siegel was formerly president of Turner Entertainment Networks, and vice chairman of Up TV, which he co-founded in 2004.[11][12] In March 2015, Radio One announced a deal to buy out Comcast's 47.9% share of TV One for $550 million.[13]
In mid to late 2015, Radio One purchased, from Comcast, the balance of the ownership interest in the network it didn't already control, placing TV One as the only minority-owned general-interest TV network in the country.[2][3]
In February 2016, TV One updated their logo again, along with a new slogan, "Represent."
