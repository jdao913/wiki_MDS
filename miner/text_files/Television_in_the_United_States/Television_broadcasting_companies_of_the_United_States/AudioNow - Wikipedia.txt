History[edit]
AudioNow was founded in 2008 by Elan Blutinger. Blutinger has been a Managing Director of Alpine Consolidated, LLC since 1996 and led the successful launch, IPO, and sale of multiple public travel companies in the US and the UK: He subsequently was a Director at Hotels.com and chaired the Special Committee that sold the company to IAC/ InterActiveCorp.
The 2010 Haiti earthquake forced the business to expand to Haiti.[2] Partners include the United Nations, BBC, Voice of America, Al Jazeera, IMG College, C-SPAN, Adventist World Radio, Radio Free Asia, and Radio France Internationale.[3][4][5][6]
