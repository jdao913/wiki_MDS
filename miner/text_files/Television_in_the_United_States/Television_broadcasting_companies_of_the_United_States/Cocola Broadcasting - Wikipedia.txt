Cocola Broadcasting is a broadcasting company based in Fresno, California. Founded in the early 1980s by Valley broadcasting veteran Gary Cocola, Cocola owns two full-power digital television stations KGMC in Fresno and KKJB in Boise, along with several low-power television stations in Central California and Boise. Cocola was one of the first broadcasters in the US to take advantage of the opportunities of low-powered television, after the FCC approved such stations in the early 1980s.
