Cox Media Group, Inc., a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises, is an integrated broadcasting, publishing and digital media company that also includes the direct marketing company Valpak[1] and the national advertising rep firms of Cox Reps.[2] The company operations include 15 broadcast television stations and one local cable channel, 86 radio stations,[3] four metro newspapers,[4] more than a dozen non-daily publications and more than 100 digital services. Cox Media Group is headquartered at 6205 Peachtree Dunwoody Road in Atlanta, Georgia.[5]
In December 2008,[6] Cox Enterprises created Cox Media Group (CMG) by merging Cox Newspapers,[7] Cox Radio, and Cox Television into one integrated digital media company. The creation of Cox Media Group was a departure from grouping subsidiaries based solely on publishing medium.[8]
In August 2009, Cox Enterprises realigned its radio, television, newspaper/publishing, and digital assets into the same division.[9] Under the new structure, while the local brands remain independent, they share resources and some management. Dayton, Ohio, was considered the prototype for the media group, where radio, television, newspaper, and direct mail were all in the same market and were combined into a new building.[10] In other markets where the facilities aren't as close together, they do share some senior management; for example Houston & San Antonio Radio and the Austin American-Statesman newspaper all fall under the same regional vice president. In addition to the radio/TV stations and newspapers, Cox Media Group encompasses Cox Digital Solutions (digital sales for both Cox and non-Cox online and mobile properties), Cox Reps (national TV sales for station groups such as Gray and Gannett), Kudzu.com, Savings.com, and Valpak direct mail.[11]
CMG introduced a new group buying discount program called DealSwarm in October 2010.[12] DealSwarm provides online discounts at local businesses. The program is active in such Cox Media Group properties as Atlanta, Austin and Dayton.
In April 2013, CMG launched the online-only new site Rare.us as a conservative media source, originally with the tagline “Red is the Center” and more recently “America’s News Feed.”[13] After initially-low audience numbers, the site expanded dramatically following more prominent use of social media and a more diverse range of stories.[13]
In July, 2012 CMG announced its intention to sell its radio stations in smaller markets: Birmingham, Greenville, Hawaii, Louisville, Richmond, and Southern Connecticut. It also intends to spin off its smaller market television stations in El Paso, Johnstown, Reno, and Steubenville.[14] The company said it intended to focus on larger markets or smaller markets that could be clustered together with other CMG properties. On February 12, 2013, CMG announced the sale of the Birmingham, Greenville, Hawaii, Louisville, and Richmond radio stations to Summit Media, and the southern Connecticut stations to Connoisseur Media;[15] two weeks later, on February 25, the company announced the sale of the four television stations (and the local marketing agreement for a fifth) to Sinclair Broadcast Group.[16]

Cox Radio[edit]
Cox Media Group owns, operates or provides sales and marketing services to 57 stations in 20 markets. This radio portfolio includes 71 FM stations and 15 AM stations.[18] Cox Radio became a public company, majority owned by Cox Enterprises, in 1996. Around April 2009, Cox Enterprises proposed a $69 million United States dollar takeover offer of Cox Radio. The offer expired on May 1, 2009.[19] The offer was later raised to $4.80 a share, and the expiration was pushed to May 13.[20] The offer was accepted, and the acquisition was completed on June 1.[21]
