Digital transition[edit]
As EICB TV is structured as a series of low-power stations, its analog transmitters were not required to transition to digital broadcasting when full-power stations did so in 2009.
Various stations in this group have applied to convert to digital on their existing channel assignments, increase power or relocate closer to the center of a broadcast market. All of these measures are voluntary.
