Entravision Communications Corporation is a media company based in Santa Monica, California. Entravision primarily caters to the Spanish-speaking Hispanic community and owns television and radio stations and outdoor media, in several of the top Hispanic markets. They are the largest affiliate group of the Univision and UniMás television networks.[3] Entravision also owns a small number of English-language television and radio stations.
On August 4, 2006, Entravision sold five of their radio stations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area to Liberman Broadcasting.[4] On May 16, 2008, the company sold its outdoor media division, whose operations were primarily based in New York and Los Angeles, to Lamar Advertising Company.[5]
In 2007, Entravision Communications Corporation acquired Spanish-language radio station WNUE-FM serving the Orlando, Florida, market from Mega Communications for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $24 million.[6]
