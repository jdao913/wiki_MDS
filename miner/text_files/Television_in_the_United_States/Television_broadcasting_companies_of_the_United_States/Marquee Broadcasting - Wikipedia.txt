Marquee Broadcasting, Inc. is a small broadcasting company which owns several television stations in the United States.
History[edit]
Marquee began in 2013 when its owners, Brian and Patricia Lane, announced its intent to acquire WMDT and its repeater, WEVD-LP for $9 million.[1]
The company's next acquisition came in 2015 when it closed its acquisition of WUGA-TV from the University of Georgia for $2.5 million. Following the acquisition, the station's primary affiliation changed to Heroes & Icons and changed its callsign to WGTA.[2]
In May 2016, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced its sale of KREG-TV to Marquee Broadcasting.[3]
On April 5, 2017, Max Media announced that it entered an agreement to sell NBC affiliate WNKY in Bowling Green, Kentucky to Marquee.[4][5]
