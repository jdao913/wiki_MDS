History[edit]
Max Media was founded in 2001. Prior to this, some of the company's management had run the TVX Broadcast Group from 1979 until its sale to Paramount Communications (who renamed it the Paramount Stations Group) in 1991, and Max Media Properties (similarly named to the current company) from then until its sale to the Sinclair Broadcast Group (which owned some former TVX stations) in 1998.
On September 30, 2013, the Cowles Publishing Company acquired Max's Montana television station cluster for $18 million.[1][2] On October 31, 2013, Sinclair acquired the non-license assets of WPFO for $13.6 million; the deal made it a sister station to WGME-TV, which already produced a newscast for the station.[3] On November 20, it was announced that Cunningham Broadcasting will acquire the license assets for $3.4 million.[4] The sale of the license assets was approved on June 23, 2017.[5] The sale of the license assets was approved on June 23, 2017.[6]
On January 9, 2014, Max Media sold its six Arkansas-based radio stations to Bobby Caldwell's East Arkansas Broadcasters for $3 million.
Effective November 5, 2015, Max Media sold its four Pennsylvania-based radio stations to Kristin Cantrell's Southern Belle, LLC for $3.8 million.
On April 5, 2017, Max Media announced that it was selling NBC affiliate WNKY in Bowling Green, Kentucky to Marquee Broadcasting for $5.6 million.[7][8] The sale was completed on June 30.[9][10]
