Mission Broadcasting, Inc. is a television station group that owns 20 television stations in 17 markets in the United States. The group's Chair is Nancie Smith, the widow of David S. Smith (who died in March 2011), who founded the company in 1998.[1] All of Mission's stations are located in markets where the Nexstar Media Group also owns a station, and all of Mission's stations are managed by Nexstar through shared services and local marketing agreements—allowing duopolies between the top two stations in a market or in markets with too few stations to allow duopolies.[2]
