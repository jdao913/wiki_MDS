History[edit]
The company was originally known as Morgan Murphy Stations until 2007, when its operating name was slightly changed to Morgan Murphy Media. [1]
On May 10, 2017, the company announced that it would acquire Saga Communications' television clusters in Joplin, Missouri, including KOAM-TV, and Victoria, Texas, including KAVU-TV. Saga will additionally acquire the assets of Fox affiliates in each market owned by Surtsey Media and operated by Saga under local marketing agreements. These stations' license assets will be acquired by SagamoreHill Broadcasting.[2] The sale was completed September 1.[3][4]
