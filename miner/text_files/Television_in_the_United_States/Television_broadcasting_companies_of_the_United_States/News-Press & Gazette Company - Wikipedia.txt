History[edit]




News-Press headquarters in St. Joseph


The company traces it roots back to the St. Joseph Gazette which began publishing in 1845. The paper chronicled much of travel into the Old West along the Oregon Trail and California Trail. It was the only newspaper that was sent west on the first ride of the Pony Express. The Gazette eventually merged with the News-Press by publisher Charles M. Palmer. When Palmer died in 1949, Henry D. Bradley was co-publisher of both papers starting in 1939 and bought them outright in 1951.
The Gazette ceased publication in 1988 when its sister, the afternoon News-Press, transitioned into a morning newspaper; however, the family kept the "Gazette" and "G" in the company name. The Bradley family expanded the focus by forming local cable television operator St. Joseph Cablevision in 1965. News-Press & Gazette expanded into broadcast television with the 1995 purchase of KVIA-TV in El Paso, Texas; this expansion continued into the 2000s with the launch of a 24-hour cable-only news channel for St. Joseph, St. Joe NOW, along with News-Press & Gazette's acquisition of several full-power and low-power television stations (such as KECY-TV in El Centro, California, KJCT in Grand Junction, Colorado and KTVZ in Bend, Oregon).
In 2011, the Bradley family sold the cable division, which by that time expanded its service area to parts of California and Arizona under the name NPG Cable, to Suddenlink Communications.[1] On March 19, 2012, News-Press & Gazette announced it would establish a low-power television station in St. Joseph that would serve as the company's television flagship and the first broadcast station that the company built and signed on; it would be an affiliate of the Fox Broadcasting Company (with subchannel-only affiliations with The CW and Telemundo). The station was created using the K26LV-D station license (which it acquired, along with K16KF-D, from Sunrise, Florida-based DTV America 1, LLC on March 14 of that year);[2][3] it launched on June 2, 2012, as KNPN-LD.[4] On July 25, 2012, NPG announced an agreement to purchase ABC affiliate KMIZ and FOX affiliate, KQFX-LD from JW Broadcasting.[5] The deal was consummated on November 1.
