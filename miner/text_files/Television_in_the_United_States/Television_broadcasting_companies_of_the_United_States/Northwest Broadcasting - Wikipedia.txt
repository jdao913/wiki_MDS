Northwest Broadcasting is a television broadcasting company based in Okemos, Michigan, a suburb of Lansing. The broadcasting group owns or operates twelve television stations in six markets, through subsidiaries such as Broadcasting Communications, Mountain Communications, Stainless Broadcasting, and Bristlecone Broadcasting.[1]
Northwest Broadcasting was founded in 1995 by Brian Brady to acquire the television stations of Salmon River Communications, including KAYU-TV in Spokane, Washington, K68EB in Yakima, Washington, KBWU-LP in the Tri-Cities (Richland-Kennewick-Pasco, Washington), and KMVU in Medford, Oregon.[2] In 1997, Northwest purchased Stainless, Inc. for $17 million; while Stainless was primarily a manufacturer of broadcasting towers, the purchase also added WICZ-TV in Binghamton, New York and KTVZ in Bend, Oregon to Northwest's station group.[3][4] Stainless had owned broadcast stations since purchasing WICZ (then known as WINR-TV) in 1971.[5] Though Northwest would sell the Stainless tower company to SpectraSite Holdings in 1999[6] and KTVZ to News-Press & Gazette Company in 2002,[7] it still owns WICZ-TV under the Stainless Broadcasting Company name.
Brian Brady expanded his broadcast holdings in 2002, when he teamed up with Alta Communications to acquire the K-Six Television stations under the name Eagle Creek Broadcasting;[8] Alta had also invested in Northwest Broadcasting in 1996.[9] Alta divested its interest in Northwest Broadcasting in 2007[10] and in Eagle Creek Broadcasting in 2013.[11] During the 2010s, Brady acquired additional stations through companies such as Blackhawk Broadcasting,[12] Bristlecone Broadcasting,[13] and Cedar Creek Broadcasting.[14] These companies have occasionally made joint filings with Northwest Broadcasting in Federal Communications Commission proceedings under the name "The TV Station Group."[15]
