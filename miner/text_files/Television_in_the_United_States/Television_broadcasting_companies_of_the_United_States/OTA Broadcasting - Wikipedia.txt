History[edit]
OTA Broadcasting was founded in 2011 by Michael Dell's MSD Capital. It had been rumored that Dell formed OTA Broadcasting to buy stations that could be sold in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) spectrum auction.[1]
The company's first acquisition was announced in June 2011 when it was announced that it was acquiring KTLN-TV in San Rafael, California.[2] The purchase closed that October.
OTA reached an agreement to purchase WTBL-CD in Lenoir, NC, located in the Charlotte DMA, for $500,000.[3]
On October 4, 2013, Journal Broadcast Group announced that it had entered an agreement to sell KMIR-TV and KPSE-LD in Palm Springs, California to OTA.[4] The acquisition closed in January 2014. KMIR became OTA's first station affiliated with one of the "Big Three" networks.
On April 13, 2017, the FCC announced that OTA's WEMW-CD was a successful bidder in the spectrum auction, and would be surrendering its license in exchange for $12,394,400.[5] OTA surrendered WEMW-CD's license to the FCC for cancellation on July 21, 2017.
Post-spectrum auction[edit]
On July 21, 2017, OTA Broadcasting announced its sale of KMIR-TV and KPSE-LD to Entravision Communications for $21 million.[6] The sale completed November 1, 2017.[7]
On August 7, 2017, it was announced that Nexstar Media Group would acquire the non-spectrum operating assets of WLWC from OTA.[8]
Weigel Broadcasting, on October 25, 2017, announced it would acquire KAXT-CD, KTLN-TV, KFFV, and KVOS-TV for $23.2 million.[9]
NBCUniversal filed an application to purchase WYCN-CD on October 27, 2017.[10]
