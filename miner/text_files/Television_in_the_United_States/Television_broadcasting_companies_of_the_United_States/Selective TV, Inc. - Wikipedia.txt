Selective TV, Inc. is an over-the-air broadcasting company in Alexandria, Minnesota. It is notable for retransmitting several pay television channels for free over the air, one of only a few known broadcasters to have such an arrangement (UHF-TV Inc. in nearby Willmar being another).
Most of Selective TV's transmitters are licensed as low-power television stations; Channels 18, 27, 36, and 47 are licensed as translators. All but channel 18 are digital transmitters.
