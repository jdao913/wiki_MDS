Partial purchase of Pembrook Pines[edit]
In February 2014, the station announced the acquisition of the remains of Pembrook Pines Media Group, which includes the Cattaraugus County-based cluster of WMXO/WOEN in Olean and WQRS/WGGO in Salamanca. A sister company, Great Radio LLC, was to own Pembrook Pines' remaining assets in order to comply with ownership caps (such an arrangement would have left the Christians with control of most of Elmira's radio stations).[1] Days before the sale was to close, Vision Communications and Great Radio withdrew their bid for Pembrook Pines, after a previous bidder (Randy Reid's Titan Radio) and Vision's primary competitor in both markets (Community Broadcasters, LLC) raised objections to the Christians' concentration of media ownership in the Elmira market.[2] A revised plan submitted in August 2014 will see the Christians follow through with their purchase of the Cattaraugus County cluster while Gordy Ichikawa, who specializes in the ownership of radio broadcast towers, buys the disputed Elmira-Corning assets.[3] The sale closed September 10, 2014. The company then bought another former Pembrook Pines station, WZKZ in Alfred, in February 2015.
