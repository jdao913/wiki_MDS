Production[edit]




Creator and showrunner Anthony Anderson, while shooting season five.


Anacostia was created in 2009 by Anderson, who also writes, executive produces and stars in the series. Byrne serves as co-executive producer, with Fritz Brekeller as supervising producer, and Benjamin Bryant as Senior Producer. Lora Lee, Jamie Misiak and Alexis Robinson Smith are the series' line producers; Harold Jackson III, Anne Wells Auer and Nicole Whitmire serve as consulting producers; and Marion Akpan, Christopher Bair, Kelvin Cook, Tia Dae, Pasha Diallo, India Doy-Young, Antonio Harrison Jr., Kena Hodges, William Lash and Rolfini Whidbee serve as producers.[1][2]
Byrne, known for her longtime role on the defunct CBS soap opera As the World Turns, joined the series in the role of high-powered madame Alexis Jordan in 2011.[3] In September 2015, Soap Opera Digest reported that Byrne's former As the World Turns co-star Elizabeth Hubbard would also appear on Anacostia as Eva Montgomery, in scenes directed and co-written by Byrne.[3][4] In 2016, the show announced that writer and broadcaster Benjamin Bryant would join the production as a senior producer and creative consultant for season five.[5]
Over the series' successive seasons, Anderson has attempted to address a number of social issues through the series soap operatic lens, including realistic takes on mental illness, incest, male-male rape, and the real-life gentrification of the iconic D.C. neighborhood.[5]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Anacostia was nominated for a 2015 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding New Approaches Drama Series,[1][2] and Martha Byrne won a Daytime Emmy the same year for Outstanding Performer in a New Approaches Drama Series for her performance as Alexis Jordan.[6] Elizabeth Hubbard was nominated in 2016 for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actress in a Digital Daytime Drama Series for her role as Eva Montgomery.[7][8] In 2017, Anthony Anderson was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Digital Daytime Drama Series for his role as Sean Williams-Grey.[9]
To date, the series has won eight Indie Series Awards,[10] and has been nominated for several more.
