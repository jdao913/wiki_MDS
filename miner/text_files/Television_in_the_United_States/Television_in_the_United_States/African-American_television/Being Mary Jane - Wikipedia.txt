Production[edit]
The show was originally to be called Single Black Female.[17] The series centers on successful broadcast journalist Mary Jane Paul (played by Gabrielle Union) and her professional and private family life while searching for "Mr. Right":

Mary Jane Paul has it all: she's a successful TV news anchor, entirely self-sufficient – an all-around powerhouse who remains devoted to a family that doesn’t share her motivation. As Mary Jane juggles her life, her work and her commitment to her family, we find out how far she's willing to go to find the puzzle pieces that she, and society, insist are missing from her life as a single Black female.[18]

Omari Hardwick plays a potential Mr. Right. Other cast members include Latarsha Rose, Lisa Vidal, Aaron D. Spears, Richard Roundtree, Margaret Avery, Richard Brooks, Tika Sumpter, Raven Goodwin, B.J. Britt, and Robinne Lee.[18]
The series is produced by Mara Brock Akil, who produced BET's most successful series ever, The Game, and the romantic comedy film Jumping the Broom. The pilot episode was filmed in April 2012 at 780 N. Highland Ave. in the Virginia Highland neighborhood of Atlanta.[19][20][21]
On September 12, 2013, BET renewed Being Mary Jane for a second season, before the first season premiered.[6] The second season premiered on February 3, 2015, and on February 5 the series was renewed for a third season,[22] which premiered October 20, 2015.
Controversy[edit]
In 2016, Gabrielle Union sued BET for allegedly depriving her of agreed upon compensation.[23]
