Broadcast history[edit]
The show was 30 minutes long, originated as a local program on DuMont station WTTG in Washington, D. C. in 1947, and aired on the DuMont network from October 17, 1948 to January 9, 1949.[1] According to the book The Forgotten Network by David Weinstein (Temple University Press, 2004), the series also continued locally on WTTG after the network run ended, running to 1951 (see page 162).
The program was among the earliest U.S. television shows with an African American host, and included religious music and preaching.[2]
Episode status[edit]
As with most DuMont series, no episodes are known to survive.
