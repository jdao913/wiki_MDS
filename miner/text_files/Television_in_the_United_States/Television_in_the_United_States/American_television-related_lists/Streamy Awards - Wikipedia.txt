The Streamy Awards, often referred to as the Streamys, are presented annually by Dick Clark Productions and Tubefilter to recognize and honor excellence in online video, including directing, acting, producing, and writing. The formal ceremony at which the awards are presented takes place in Los Angeles, California.[1] They were the first envelope-opening live-streamed award show.[2]
The Streamy Awards were created by Executive Producers Drew Baldwin, Brady Brim-DeForest and Marc Hustvedt of Tubefilter[3] and Joshua Cohen and Jamison Tilsner of Tilzy.tv.[4]
The winners[5] of awards in over 30 categories,[6] including the Audience Choice and Visionary Award, were announced for the first time on March 28, 2009 at the 1st Annual Streamy Awards. Winners of the 1st Annual Streamy Awards included individual recipients (Best Male and Female Actor), and web series. Each year, certain awards are presented before the main ceremony at the Streamys Craft Awards.[7]
The 2nd Annual Streamy Awards were hosted by actor/comedian Paul Scheer and streamed live online from the Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles, California) on April 11, 2010. The production experienced technical problems as well as interruptions due to people streaking the stage and interrupting the presenters. This show incorporated an online live internet streaming broadcast.[8][9] Due to poor reception and execution of the show, the IAWTV halted its production of the award ceremony[10] and formed their own Web TV awards presentation.[10]
Tubefilter joined Dick Clark productions to produce the 3rd Streamy Awards in 2013.[11]
The 5th Streamy Awards were broadcast live on VH1 on September 17, 2015.[12]
The 7th Streamy Awards were hosted by Jon Cozart and were broadcast live on Twitter on September 26, 2017 from the Beverly Hilton Hotel.[13]

Performances[edit]




This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (February 2013)



The Streamy Awards feature performances intermittently throughout the show such as songs or skits. These acts are performed by internet personalities and musicians of note and change every year. At the 2013 Streamys, it was announced that Vanilla Ice and Shontelle would perform.[18] YouTube stars Chester See, DeStorm Power, and Peter Shukoff and Lloyd Ahlquist of Epic Rap Battles of History also performed.[19] The 4th Annual Streamy Awards in 2014 featured performances by Pentatonix, Scott Bradlee, Jhené Aiko, among others.[20]
Controversies[edit]
2010 reception controversy[edit]
The 2010 awards presentation was poorly received by audience members, viewers, and sponsors. Most complaints were in regards to technical problems and lewd jokes.[21][22][23][24][25] This caused the International Academy of Web Television to depart from the presentation of the award show, resulting in a two-year hiatus of the Streamys and the formation of the IAWTV Awards.[10]
Vitalyzvids Streamy Awards prank[edit]
At the 6th Streamy Awards, Vitaly Zdorovetskiy, a known prankster and YouTuber, crashed the stage of the awards ceremony and announced "nobody expected to see me here, but what about my soft dick?" and proceeded to lower his pants, a reference to a pornographic movie he participated in. He walked off to silence and scattered boos and hisses.
