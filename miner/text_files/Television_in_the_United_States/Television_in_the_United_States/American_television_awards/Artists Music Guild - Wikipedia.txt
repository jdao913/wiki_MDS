History[edit]
The Guild began as a safe haven for artists who had been taken advantage of in the arts community. Its focus was to place several corporations and business leaders into a position of power within the Guild so that artists would not have to leave the protection of its umbrella.[10] In April 2014 the Guild became an independent non-profit corporation and was no longer under the umbrella of its parent IAMAS Corporation.[11] In May 2015, the Guild announced its partnership with the City of Monroe, North Carolina and the Monroe Crossing Mall to open offices into the mall. The Guild was charged with the duties of bringing in arts programs into the mall at various times of the year. The Guild also coordinated an art gallery inside of the mall which displays art work from artists throughout the country and the City of Monroe. The first program presented by the Guild was a concert by country music star Terri Gibbs and the Union County Youth Ballet.[12]
Leadership[edit]
The Guild has two working boards. The first board is the "Executive Board of Directors." These are the CEO's of the Guild and owners of various other corporations. Their function is to oversee and make corporate decisions that effect the growth of the Guild as well as its visibility and expansion.[13] The second board is the "Board of Directors." It is this board that works closely with the artists and service providers to ensure the mission of the Guild is being met.[14]
Executive board of directors[edit]
The leadership of the Guild starts with Christian recording star, David L Cook. Beginning his career at the age of five with his family The Cook Family Singers, Cook spent most of his time onstage as a child.[15] Cook partnered with Chris Nowels the president of IHN Productions, Inc., located in Midlothian, Texas. Nowels and Cook had worked on various projects together.[16] Most notably the two won an Emmy Award in 2011 for their work on the documentary, "The Award Goes To: A Look Back at the Legends"[17] Elddy Trevino, owner of Loco Sound, Inc., located in Monroe, NC was added to the board and serves as a service provider and director of convention audio for the Guild's annual conventions.[18] Forrest Ward, the CEO and president of US Success Centers located in Dallas, Texas was added as an executive board member and serves as an artist educator and career builder.[19] Jason Howell, an SQL supervisor at Microsoft was added to the executive board and serves as electronic media and marketing. Howell maintains the Guild's websites and builds artist member websites.[20] Philip Irish, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida was added as legal adviser to the executive board. Irish is an attorney but does not represent the Guild in court actions. His role is simply to advise the Guild and to resolve disputes.[21]
Board of directors[edit]
The Guild's Board of Directors work hands on with established artists while mentoring up and coming artists. They educate artists on industry pitfalls and how to protect themselves against predatory practices. Each board member must agree to be a mentor in order to maintain their board position.[22]

Mentoring[edit]
One of the Guild's primary focus' is on education. Members of the Guild must agree to be a mentor in order to achieve and maintain their Guild membership. Once a member, they are required to help in the education sector of the public school systems. Professional artists are asked to go into the classrooms to teach various skill sets such as vocal, stage presence, breathing or industry practices. The Guild works in tandem with school boards across the country to ensure teachers have continued curriculum that otherwise might be beyond their affordability.[24] In 2012, Terry Webster was added to the Guild's board of directors as the "President of Education and Programming." Webster is responsible for setting up programs within the public school systems as well as during the Guild's convention and awards shows.[25] Many professional artists lend their talents to the continuing curriculum to be taught in the classroom. Chubby Checker serves as the Guild's spokesperson and front man who makes public appearances into the classrooms in an effort to excite young people about the arts and a possible career opportunities. In an effort to ensure each school child has a proper start the Guild provides book bags and school supplies to all children attending their conventions and awards broadcast. They also provide schools with various instruments and equipment that the schools may need but do not have the financial means to procure.[26]
