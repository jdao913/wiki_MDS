History[edit]
The Broadcast Television Journalists Association (BTJA) was founded in 2011 as an offshoot of the Broadcast Film Critics Association. The Awards are produced by executive producer Bob Bain.[6]
According to the acting president of the BTJA, Joey Berlin, the Critics' Choice Television Awards were launched "to enhance access for broadcast journalists covering the television industry. Just as the Critics’ Choice Movie Awards has been established as an important part of the annual movie awards season, we are confident that the Critics' Choice Television Awards will play a similar role for the television industry."[7]
