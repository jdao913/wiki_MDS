The Golden Boot Awards is an American acknowledgment of achievement honoring actors, actresses, and crew members who have made significant contributions to the genre of Western television and movies. The award is sponsored and presented by the Motion Picture & Television Fund. Money raised at the award banquet is used to help finance various services offered by the Fund to those in the entertainment industry.
Actor Pat Buttram conceived the idea of the Golden Boot Award, and the first ones were presented in 1983. The awards appear to have been discontinued since 2007.
