Live championship boxing[edit]

In 2011, WealthTV began airing live professional boxing branded under "Wealth TV's Fight Night". In July 2012, the network aired its first live pay-per-view (PPV) event branded "Wealth TV PPV". Wealth TV received multiple recognitions for its boxing efforts in 2012. The Boxing Writers Association of America, BWAA, recognized six fights for 2012 as nominees for best fight of the year, two of which were aired live on Wealth TV.[4] David Price, a heavyweight boxer featured exclusively in the US on Wealth TV in 2012, was recognized by leading boxing authority Dan Rafael of ESPN as the top Prospect of the Year.[5]
In the past, AWE has brought boxing fans some of the most exciting and controversial bouts including the matchup of Ricky Burns against Ray Beltran for the world lightweight title (2013);[6] the crowning of American, Terence Crawford, after his defeat of Ricky Burns (2014);[7] and several bouts demonstrating the explosive power of undefeated heavyweight Tyson Fury. In 2017, AWE was the exclusive provider for the historic matchup between legendary British heavyweights David Haye and Tony Bellew.[8]
Controversies[edit]
In 2007 and 2008 Wealth TV filed carriage access complaints at the FCC against the iN DEMAND owners, namely Comcast, Time Warner, Bright House, and Cox Communications. As of December 2012, the complaints are on appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court of California.[9]
On December 11, 2007, Wealth TV issued a press release accusing a technology blog, Engadget HD, of launching an attack on it just days after Wealth TV engaged in a dispute with Time Warner Cable, partly owned by Engadget's corporate then-parent AOL Time Warner.
