Christian Television Network (CTN) is a non-profit broadcast television network of small owned-and-operated stations (O&O) that broadcasts religious programming. It is based in Largo, Florida (with a mailing address of Clearwater), and the flagship station is WCLF channel 22, which signed on the air in the Tampa Bay region in 1979. It is now available on DirecTV channel 376 and Dish Network channel 267/9399. It was founded by Robert D'Andrea, who is still the president.
In addition to the main network, CTN also operates CTNi, a Spanish-language Christian network; and LifeStyle Family TV, which offers entertainment programming with a Christian slant. These services are available as subchannels on most CTN stations.
