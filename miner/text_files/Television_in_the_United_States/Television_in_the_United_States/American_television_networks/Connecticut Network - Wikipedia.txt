The Connecticut Network, also known as CT-N, is a 24-hour Cable TV Government-access television (GATV) network that provides coverage of Connecticut state government and public affairs.[1][2] Founded in 1999, the television network and its programming are the products of the Connecticut General Assembly but is currently managed by a nonprofit organization called the Connecticut Public Affairs Network, under contract with the Connecticut Office of Legislative Management.
