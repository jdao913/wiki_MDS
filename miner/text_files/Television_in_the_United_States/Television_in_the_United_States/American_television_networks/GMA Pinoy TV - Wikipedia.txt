History[edit]
2005–2014[edit]
GMA Pinoy TV was first launched in Japan on March 2005. It was later launched in several parts of the United States in the same year, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and the states of the East Coast. The official GMA Pinoy TV launch in America happened in San Francisco on 23 July 2005 and was aired on SOP the following Sunday, 31 July 2005.
In 2006, the so-called Filipino colors—red, blue and yellow—were used for the graphics and since December 2006, the on-screen graphics of GMA Pinoy TV is being changed every Christmas season.
In 2008, GMA Pinoy TV was also known for the program Dyesebel. Due to the success of the program, GMA Pinoy TV launched a billboard in Daly City, which was there for the entirety of the show.
The logo also was seen in the upper right and left corners at varied times. It was settled in 2007 that the logo will be seen in the upper right corner. In 2007, GMA Pinoy TV became a huge success and was known better known because of Marimar. Due to the success of the program, GMA Pinoy TV once changed graphics, which has been used from 2007 to October 2010.
An associated second channel, GMA Life TV, was successfully launched in March 2008 and soon grew to 109,000 subscribers. GMA Pinoy TV had 225,000 subscribers as of September 2009. The percent of subscribers has gone up 34% according to GMA New Media, Inc.
In 2010, an amount of PhP253 million for the 1st Quarter of 2010's revenues was posted in the Annual Stockholders Meeting of GMA Network for GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV. In May 2010, GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Network were acclaimed for their performance of covering the elections. The said election coverage was aired live on GMA Pinoy TV on 9 May until the Election ended. Based on the September 2010 report posted by the Corporate Communications Department of GMA Network, GMA Pinoy TV had a total of 256,000 subscribers while its sister channel, GMA Life TV had 122,000 subscribers.[1] On 10 October 2010 (otherwise known was 10-10-10), GMA Pinoy TV changed graphics with a theme that recognizes and is towards Pinoys all over the world. It also has a globe symbolizing how far GMA Pinoy TV has gone since the start. On Christmas 2010, GMA Pinoy TV used the slogan "Isang Maligayang at Masaganang Paskong Pinoy, Kapuso." This was the first time that GMA Pinoy TV used another Christmas slogan besides the GMA Network Christmas 2010 slogan, "Isang Pagkilala sa Puso ng Pilipino Ngayong Pasko." As for the 3rd Quarter of 2010, GMA Pinoy TV had around 261,000 subscribers posted.[2] As of December 2010, GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV has expanded into the following: Chicago, Illinois (via Comcast Chicago); New York (via Time Warner New York); Washington, D.C., Maryland, Alabama, Virginia (via Comcast); Vancouver, British Columbia (via Telus Canada); and Italy, London, and the rest of UK and rest of Europe (via Infinity IPTV).[3] In a report published showing GMA Network's revenues for 2010 with a total of PhP 14.299 billion, GMA Life TV has 125,000 subscribers (an estimated 800,000 viewers count) while GMA Pinoy TV has an accounted 274,000 subscribers (around 1.8 million viewers).[4][5]
In 2011, the delays of the shows on GMA Pinoy TV receded from months of delay to two days delay for primetime shows and three days delay for afternoon dramas. On the first quarter of 2011, GMA Pinoy TV and its home network in the Philippines revealed a new logo with minor changes. The "GMA" letters part is seen to be more embossed and the logo has a "glow" effect. On 28 February 2011 for the first time in GMA International's history, two programs that started airing on GMA Pinoy TV that were still running with new episodes were switched over to GMA Life TV, where it will then air its new episodes to occupy free time slots. This then led to replays of other Kapuso shows. The shows included Pinoy MD and Love ni Mister, Love ni Misis. All this will be straightened out once GMA News TV starts its international operations sometime 2nd to 3rd quarter of 2011.
On 10 March 2011 GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV expanded even more in the United States in Florida. The Florida counties that are part of the extension include Brevard, Flagler, Lake, Marion, Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Sumter and Volusia. On 5 April 2011, though already launched in the Philippines on 27 March 2011, GMA Pinoy TV officially launched the 2011 summer slogan of GMA "Halo-Halo Ang Summer Saya". This took some time to launch on GMA Pinoy TV because significant edits were made in which some of the programs on the original version were not slated to air on GMA Pinoy TV like Man vs. Beast but beside that, the international version of the station ID still included planned shows of Summer 2011. Also in April 2011, GMA Pinoy TV is now being broadcast by COX Communications in Arizona, areas like Tucson and Arizona, on Channel 482.[6] In a report dated 16 May 2011 regarding the consolidated gross revenues of GMA Network, Inc. in the 1st quarter of 2011, it is noted that GMA Pinoy TV's subscriptions grew by 10 percent (approximately 300,000 subscribers) and GMA Life TV's subscriptions grew by 2 percent (approximately 128,000). This consisted of PhP 230 million worth of advertising and subscription revenues.[7] In another recent report with regards to GMA Network's consolidated revenues in the 2nd quarter of 2011, GMA Pinoy TV's subscribers grew to 279,000 from 274,000 (actual count) and an estimated number of 1.85 million viewers and GMA Life TV's subscribers grew as well, an estimated 1 million viewers. Also, GMA Network recently launched GMA News TV in the past month and will be made available to all areas where GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV reaches by 3rd Quarter of 2011. GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV were further made to subscribers in key Filipino-American areas in the US, namely New Jersey, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and Washington D.C. They were also launched in many parts of Detroit, Hawaii and upstate New York and New England. The channels were also launched by additional carriers in Australia and Papua New Guinea.[8]
On 5 October 2011, GMA Pinoy TV accepted two awards from the National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications (NAMIC) in New York for 2011 Excellence in Multicultural Marketing Awards.[9] On 4 November 2011, GMA Pinoy TV launched GMA's 2011 Christmas Station ID in several parts with each cast of most Kapuso shows and it was usually during the show and one right after the show ended. On 24 November 2011, Thanksgiving Day in the US, GMA Pinoy TV launched the Christmas-themed graphics for 2011, which also included the upper-right logo being converted to a Christmas-themed one. This was also the same date that GMA Network revamped its websites, with new features and a new look. On December 2011, GMA Pinoy TV’s subscriber count closed at 291,309, a 7% increase over the 2010 closing subscriber number of 273,317. Because of this, revenues grew by 8% year-on-year and are expected to grow at that rate 2012 onwards.[10]
On 2012, My Beloved became is the first primetime TV Drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere on GMA Pinoy TV. On 15 March 2012, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-screen graphics, replacing the 2010 version of approximately 30 seconds to one that is approximately 15 seconds.
In a press statement released by GMA Network, Inc., it was stated that GMA Pinoy TV, as of 1st Quarter of 2012, has approximately 303,000 subscribers, which numbers nearly 2 million viewers.[11][12][13]
On 18 May 2012, GMA Pinoy TV released on-air alternate versions of its "Up Next" and "You're Watching" bumpers; they were much shorter and instead of clips of the shows, they featured the stars of the respective shows. On 5 June 2012, GMA Pinoy TV began experiencing audio issues with its broadcast, audio that is not so typical of High-Definition, High-Resolution cameras tha GMA uses. On 21 June 2012, the issue was resolved and the original audio type was restored. For the first time in GMA history, Idol sa Kusina, a program originally aired on QTV then GMA News TV and simulcast on GMA Life TV moved to GMA Pinoy TV on 14 July 2012. In September 2012, for the first time in GMA Pinoy TV's history, 24 Oras, the network's flagship newscast program will had a four-hour-delayed telecast, meaning in the US, the show aired 7:30am (US-PST), 10:30am (US-EST), and 4:30am (Hawaii). This is the first time the network has placed 24 Oras right after Unang Hirit, which also changed timeslots to give way for 24 Oras.
As of 30 October 2012, four drama series were premiered that were one-day delayed: My Beloved, One True Love, Coffee Prince, and Temptation of Wife. This is part of GMA Pinoy TV's promise to its viewers to lessen airing delays and more original programming being shown. On 30 November 2012, GMA Pinoy TV updated its upper-right corner logo once more to a Christmas-themed one and one that celebrates GMA Pinoy TV's 7th anniversary and the version of the letters "GMA" are the more current one used by GMA. The on-air Christmas graphics which has been annually seen on GMA Pinoy TV was subsequently launched on 1 December 2012 and will last until the first week of January 2013. On 31 December 2012, GMA Pinoy TV aired Win na Win sa 2013: The GMA New Year Countdown live, making it the third time that GMA aired its New Year countdown live worldwide (previously in 2008 and 2011).
On 2013, Indio and Mundo Mo'y Akin became the fifth and sixth TV Drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere on GMA Pinoy TV. This makes all the current and future primetime dramas of GMA to air on a one-day episode delay basis, compared to previously where it started first as long as three-weeks delay to as short as two-days delay. For the first time on GMA Pinoy TV, copyrighted material created and produced by another company, National Geographic Channel, was aired on GMA Pinoy TV on 7 April 2013. The copyrighted material aired under license is the National Geographic Channel Documentary entitled Inside Malacanang Palace, which aired on March 2012, is a special documentary that takes the audience to an exclusive guided tour of the Malacanang Palace of the Philippines.
On the first quarter of 2013, GMA Pinoy TV had a total of 333,000 subscribers while its sister channel, GMA Life TV had 125,000 subscribers. This is based on a report that the Corporate Communications Department of GMA Network has posted. Overall, in 2012 and Q1 of 2013, subscription to GMA International channels increased by 7 percent.[14] On June 2013, SingTel relaunched this channel together with GMA Life TV and in the new Fiesta Pack as well after 2 months of hiatus of this channel.
Anna Karenina and My Husband's Lover became the seventh and eighth primetime TV drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere. On 27 August 2013, Pyra: Ang Babaeng Apoy started airing and was the first GMA Afternoon Prime drama series to be on only a one-episode delay basis, as for previous years, GMA Afternoon Prime dramas have been noted to be two to even four episodes delayed. On 10 September 2013, Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas became the ninth primetime TV drama series of GMA Network to premiere just a day after its original premiere on GMA Pinoy TV.
On 17 September 2013, GMA Pinoy TV had experienced technical problems and thus a three-hour delay was caused in its programming schedule, which received negative feedback from the viewers as they were not warned beforehand. The management had appealed to the viewers by saying that such was not intentional and was accidental because of technical/conversion issues. The following day, 18 September 2013, the programming staff of GMA Pinoy TV was prompted to change the programming schedule, effectively removing the airings of Eat Bulaga! and 24 Oras just a few hours after its original broadcast. Viewers are still hoping for the programming of GMA Pinoy TV to revert to its original state, which most viewers preferred.
On 29 September 2013, a fire hit the basement of GMA Network's Building. The fire was put out in less than 50 minutes as the fire correspondents responded immediately. The fire affected the power supply of GMA Network and thus further affected the normal operations of GMA Network, including the operations of GMA Pinoy TV as well as GMA Life TV and GMA News TV International.[15][16] During the fire, temporary programming was aired consisting of replays of shows from the weekend. The fire had caused disappointment and inconvenience on the part of the viewers/subscribers. However, the management of GMA International assured its subscribers that indeed the appropriate measures are being taken and that normal operations are hoped to be restored at the soonest possible time. On 1 October 2013, programming had slowly been restored. Subscribers reported Unang Hirit, 24 Oras, The Ryzza Mae Show and Eat Bulaga! among others to be updated and though slightly off their appropriate timeslot, still was managed to be aired over on GMA Pinoy TV. Also, My Husband's Lover aired back-to-back episodes and thus only on 1 October did it become the first TV series of GMA Drama to air the same episode that aired in the Philippines on the same day that it aired on GMA Pinoy TV. Akin Pa Rin ang Bukas and Kahit Nasaan Ka Man followed and also had back-to-back episodes aired; these "back-to-back" episode appeared to the viewers as hints that the primetime dramas will begin to air on same-day episode basis. However, this idea was dismissed on 2 October 2013 when these shows had re-aired the "catch up" episodes and thus, the primetime dramas were confirmed to be on a one-episode delay basis again. The network's afternoon dramas, Prinsesa ng Buhay Ko, Magkano Ba ang Pag-ibig? and Pyra: Ang Babaeng Apoy, are still airing on a one-episode delay basis and were not affected by the "catching up" that happened on 1 October. The only afternoon drama left airing on a two-episode delay basis is Mga Basang Sisiw.
On 5 October 2013, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-air title screen, in celebration of its "8 Years of Bringing Global Pinoys Closer to Home." On 30 November 2013, GMA Pinoy TV updated its upper-right logo to a Christmas-themed one, alongside GMA's Christmas Theme for 2013, "Sundan Natin ang Bituin Pabalik sa Kanyang Piling". The following day, 1 December 2013, the on-air title screen and graphics were updated.
On 17 December 2013, The Ryzza Mae Show and Eat Bulaga! were restored to their late night timeslots in the North American feed. It was noted that subscribers continually pleaded GMA Pinoy TV to restore these shows to their late night timeslots as this is convenient for many working subscribers who are only able to watch at that time. After three months and a day of requests, the management finally granted such and the shows were restored to their respective and consecutive late night timeslots. In addition to their restored timeslots, the two shows air as well right after their restored timeslots and so, overall, The Ryzza Mae Show and Eat Bulaga air four times on GMA Pinoy TV daily. The New Year Countdown aired on a three-hour delay basis on GMA Pinoy TV on 31 December 2013. From 31 December 2013 to 13 January 2014, GMA Pinoy TV had a special airing of Titser. This was in the timeslot previously occupied by Genesis and Akin Pa Rin Ang Bukas, as in the Philippines the timeslots of the two shows were replaced by Hollywood blockbusters.
The GMA Pinoy TV on-screen graphics and logo returned to its regular version on 5 January 2014, marking the end of the Christmas season. GMA Pinoy TV began inserting English subtitles in certain shows like Wish Ko Lang, Pepito Manaloto: Ang Tunay na Kuwento and Magpakailanman on Saturday, 11 January 2014. This is part of GMA Pinoy TV's efforts to expand its audience reach so that not only those who can speak and understand Tagalog can watch GMA Pinoy TV but also those who cannot.
On 22 April 2014, GMA Pinoy TV began to air Full House, the first Tagalog-dubbed Koreanovela aired on this channel. The shows with English subtitles are noted in the next section "currently broadcast". Basta Every Day, Happy! was supposed to premiere on 12 May 2014 (in some territories like the US on the evening of 11 May 2014) and air throughout its entire duration on GMA Pinoy TV but the programming department of GMA International, GMA's international subsidiary, decided to move the show over to GMA Life TV as it adheres more to GMA Life TV's overall theme as a lifestyle channel as well as the show is a replacement for Kusina Master, so the programming department had seen that the move was done rightfully so.
On 26 May 2014, GMA Pinoy TV began to air Niño with no episode delay whatsoever, thus premiering on the same day. This is a historical event for GMA Pinoy TV, as GMA drama series have never aired without episode delays. The nearest to not having a delay was the one-episode delay policy that was established on 14 February 2012 with the premiere of My Beloved. What is going to happen is in the North American feed as well as on the Australian feed, the premiere of Niño and subsequent new episodes on same-day airing will take place on the evening telecast and replays in the afternoon telecasts while in other feeds, particularly, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia Pacific and European feeds, the premiere and subsequent new episodes will take place in the afternoon telecasts and replays on evening telecasts, thus because these telecasts will take place in the afternoon, such is still not considered delayed, as a new episode of the show still has not premiered. This similar framework followed with Ang Dalawang Mrs. Real, which premiered on 2 June airing on same-day basis as well along with Strawberry Lane on 15 September and Hiram na Alaala on 22 September. Ilustrado, the first BayaniSerye on Philippine Primetime, had a world premiere on all feeds of GMA Pinoy TV on 20 October 2014; this was simultaneous with the premiere in the Philippines and this is the first time such has happened in GMA Pinoy TV history.
On December 2014, GMA Pinoy TV updated its on-air title screen and graphics and upper-right logo to a Christmas-themed one, alongside GMA's Christmas theme for 2014, "Share the Love". On December 31, 2014, Countdown to 2015: The GMA New Year Countdown Special aired live on GMA Pinoy TV.
2015–present[edit]
The GMA Pinoy TV on-screen graphics and logo returned to its regular version on 4 January 2015, marking the end of the Christmas season. In the 1st quarter of 2015, in response to viewers' requests and to remain competitive in the international market, GMA Pinoy TV began to increase the number of shows with English subtitles, now including daily dramas like Let the Love Begin and The Rich Man's Daughter.
On May 10, 2015, Willie Revillame's Wowowin premiered on GMA Network and on GMA Pinoy TV, serving as his return to the Kapuso Network. It is noted that Revillame's popular Wowowee aired for five years on GMA and GMA Pinoy TV's rival stations.[17]
On July 27, 2015, the sixth and final State of the Nation Address of President Benigno S. Aquino II aired live in the Asia Pacific and aired on a delay basis in North America, North Africa, the Middle East and Europe.[18]
In mid-2015 GMA's programming changed from news to other programs to four-five hours programming of Pinoy Telenovela block starting with its AfternoonPrime to GMA telebabad Programming with some programs one day delayed however, has caught up throughout with its future schedules. Eat Bulaga airs its initial programming, and Wowowin, Daily news as well and other programming.
Promotion[edit]
On May to June 2011, GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV sent many of its artists to various places worldwide, it's the first time that Kapuso artists were sent almost consecutively, to celebrate Philippine Independence Day, Filipino Culture Fiestas and to promote GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV and its shows. They consisted of Iza Calzado & Dennis Trillo who went to Hawaii on 7 May 2011, then on 28 May 2011, Jolina Magdangal and JayR visited National City in San Diego, CA. On the 113th Philippine Independence Day proper, Dennis Trillo & Iza Calzado were sent this time to Hong Kong to represent GMA Pinoy TV and perform there and in Singapore, Dingdong Dantes and Rachel Ann Go were present. And on 25 June 2011, Carla Abellana, JayR and Frencheska Farr along with Arnel Ignacio are heading off to Toronto, Canada to be a part of the Pinoy Fiesta Trade Show there. A day after, 26 June 2011, Aljur Abrenica, Jennylyn Mercado, Iza Calzado and Mark Bautista will be sent to be part of Philippine-American Friendship Day in Jersey City, New Jersey.[19][20][21] On 2 October 2011, Heart Evangelista, Daniel Matsunaga, and former Eat Bulaga host, Kim Idol graced an event in Australia celebrating the launch of GMA News TV International as well as the strengthening presence of GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV.[22]
On 16 September 2012, in celebration of GMA Pinoy TV's 7th anniversary, Manny Many Prizes' held a special event at Universal Studios Hollywood. The live show featured the show's cast plus Dingdong Dantes, Solenn Heussaff, Julie Anne San Jose, Elmo Magalona and Rochelle Pangilinan.
To celebrate GMA Pinoy TV's 10th anniversary, GMA Pinoy TV rolled out a series of concerts, entitled "Kapusong Pinoy" followed by the name of the place as well as appearances at Filipino cultural events throughout the world, mainly in June and July to celebrate the Philippines' 117th Independence Day. GMA Pinoy TV used the hashtag #Sampuso to celebrate and highlight its 10th year of bringing Filipinos closer to home. The first two concerts were originally supposed to include GMA's Primetime Queen Marian Rivera-Dantes but because of her pregnancy, she chose to withdraw from the concerts for her and her child's safety and AiAi delas Alas served as her replacement in the first two concerts.[23] The first Sampuso concert was on May 29, 2015 (originally slated for April 24, 2015), at the Orpheum Theater in Vancouver, Canada, featuring AiAi delas Alas, Christian Bautista, Jonalyn Viray, Alden Richards, and Betong Sumaya as Antonietta of Bubble Gang. The second Sampuso concert was on May 31, 2015 (originally slated for April 26, 2015), at the City National Grove of Anaheim, California, featuring AiAi delas Alas, Christian Bautista, Jonalyn Viray, Alden Richards, and Betong Sumaya as Antonietta of Bubble Gang.
GMA announced a third concert in celebration of GMA Pinoy TV's 10th anniversary. The concert took place in New York at the Town Hall on September 5, 2015, featuring Primetime King Dingdong Dantes, AiAi delas Alas, Julie Anne San Jose, Christian Bautista, and Betong Sumaya as Antonietta of Bubble Gang.[24][25] There are more concerts in celebration of GMA Pinoy TV's 10th Anniversary slated.
