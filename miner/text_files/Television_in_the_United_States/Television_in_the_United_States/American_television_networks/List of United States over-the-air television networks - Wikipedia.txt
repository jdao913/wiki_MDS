The five major U.S. broadcast network logos


In the United States, for most of the history of broadcasting, there were only three or four major commercial national broadcast networks. From 1946 to 1956, these were ABC, CBS, NBC and DuMont (though the Paramount Television Network had some limited success during these years). From 1956 to 1986, the "Big Three" national commercial networks were ABC, CBS, and NBC (with a few limited attempts to challenge them, such as National Telefilm Associates [and its NTA Film Network] and the Overmyer Network). From 1954 to 1970, National Educational Television was the national clearinghouse for public TV programming; the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) succeeded it in 1970.
Today, more than fifty national broadcasting networks exist. Other than the non-commercial educational (NCE) PBS, which is composed of member stations, the largest broadcast television networks are the traditional Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC). Many other large networks exist, however, notably Fox and The CW which air original programming for two hours each night instead of three like the original "Big Three" do, as well as syndication services like MyNetworkTV and Ion Television which feature reruns of recent popular shows with little to no original programming. Fox has just about the same household reach percentage as the Big Three, and is therefore often considered a peer to ABC, NBC, and CBS since it has also achieved equal or better ratings since the late 1990s. Most media outlets now include Fox in what they refer to as the "Big Four" TV networks.
The transition to digital broadcasting in 2009 has allowed for television stations to offer additional programming options through digital subchannels, one or more supplementary programming streams to the station's primary channel that are achieved through multiplexing of a station's signal. A number of new commercial networks airing specialty programming such as movies, reruns of classic series and lifestyle programs have been created from companies like Weigel Broadcasting, Luken Communications and even owners of the major networks such as The Walt Disney Company (through the Disney–ABC Television Group subsidiary) and Comcast (through the NBCUniversal subsidiary). Through the use of multicasting, there have also been a number of new Spanish-language and non-commercial public TV networks that have launched.
Broadcast networks in the U.S. can be divided into four categories:

Commercial broadcast networks – which air English-language programming to a general audience (for example, CBS);
Spanish-language broadcasting networks – fully programmed networks which air Spanish-language programming to a primarily Hispanic and Latino audience (for example, Telemundo and Univision);
Educational and other non-commercial broadcast networks – which air English- and some foreign-language television programming, intended to be educational in nature or otherwise of a sort not found on commercial television (for example, PBS);
Religious broadcast networks – which air religious study and other faith-based programs, and in some cases, family-oriented secular programs (for example, Daystar).

Each network sends its signal to many local affiliate television stations across the country. These local stations then air the "network feed," with programs broadcast by each network being viewed by up to tens of millions of households across the country. In the case of the largest networks, the signal is sent to over 200 stations. In the case of the smallest networks, the signal may be sent to just a dozen or fewer stations.
As of the 2016–17 television season, there are an estimated 118.4 million households in the U.S. with at least one TV set.[1]

English-language commercial networks[edit]
Conventional networks[edit]

American Broadcasting Company (ABC) – The nation's third-largest commercial network, ABC was originally formed from the NBC Blue Network, a radio network which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced NBC to sell in 1943; the ABC-TV network began broadcasting in 1948. Owned by The Walt Disney Company, ABC airs original programming, sports, and news seven days a week. It has over 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts.
CBS (originally the Columbia Broadcasting System) – The nation's second-largest commercial network, it originated as the CBS Radio Network in 1927; the CBS-TV network commenced broadcasts in 1941. Owned by CBS Corporation, CBS airs original programming, sports and news seven days a week. The network has over 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts. For most of its existence, CBS has been the nation's most watched network.
National Broadcasting Company (NBC) – The nation's largest and oldest commercial network, the NBC-TV network was formed out of the NBC Red Network radio service, which launched in 1922; the network commenced television broadcasts in 1941. Owned by NBCUniversal, NBC airs original programming, sports and news seven days a week. It has over 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts.
Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox) – The nation's fourth-largest commercial network, Fox was launched in October 1986 through former parent News Corporation's purchase of Metromedia earlier that year (two of the network's owned-and-operated stations once owned by that group at its founding had formed the hub of the DuMont Television Network, which existed from 1944 to 1956) and the purchase of the 20th Century Fox film studio the year prior. Owned by 21st Century Fox, Fox airs first-run programming and sports seven days a week, programming two hours each night in primetime (three hours on Sundays), along with political talk program Fox News Sunday on Sunday mornings and the optional infomercial block Weekend Marketplace on Saturday mornings. (Fox also allows affiliates the option to air the Xploration Station block on Saturday mornings in place of Weekend Marketplace.) It has nearly 200 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, almost all of which air local newscasts, with some producing newscasts in-house and others airing newscasts produced by a local affiliate of another major network.
The CW – The nation's fifth-largest commercial network, The CW was originally formed by CBS Corporation and Time Warner as a replacement for The WB and UPN, both of which folded in September 2006 after 11 years of existence and whose programs formed most of its initial schedule. It maintains approximately 100 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations in the top 100 television markets; it also has approximately 90 additional cable-only and digital subchannel affiliations in smaller TV markets through a fully programmed feed known as The CW Plus. The network airs two hours of first-run programming in primetime and one hour in daytime on Monday through Fridays, as well as a five-hour children's program block on Saturday mornings called One Magnificent Morning. Unlike its four larger major network competitors, The CW does not have owned-and-operated stations in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago; the affiliates in those markets (WPIX, KTLA and WPWR-TV, respectively) are owned by Tribune Broadcasting & Fox Television Stations; despite joint ownership by CBS and Time Warner, CBS Corporation serves as the network's de facto O&O station group (Time Warner owns one station in Atlanta through its Turner Broadcasting System subsidiary, however it does not serve as the CW affiliate for the market). Some CW affiliates air local newscasts, most of which are produced by another station in the market though ten of its affiliates (most of which are owned by Tribune Broadcasting) produce local newscasts in-house.
MyNetworkTV – MyNetworkTV is a programming service owned by 21st Century Fox, which is also parent of the Fox network. It was hastily formed in February 2006 to provide programming for stations left out of affiliation with The CW, after CBS Corporation and Time Warner chose to shut down The WB and UPN to form that network. The network launched in September 2006 with a format of English-language telenovelas, but gradually switched to mainly low-budget programming by the end of its first year. Since it converted from a TV network into a programming service in 2009, MyNetworkTV fills its two-hour primetime schedule on Monday through Fridays, with reruns of drama series that originated on other broadcast and cable networks. Some MyNetworkTV affiliates air local newscasts, most of which are produced by another station in the market (San Francisco affiliate KRON-TV is the only affiliate that produces its local news programming in-house).
Ion Television – Ion (originally known as Pax TV from 1998 to 2005, and i: Independent Television from 2005 to 2007) is a mid-sized network owned by Ion Media Networks; it airs off-network repeats of recent television series and select English-language imported programming, as well as feature films for eighteen hours per day. Ion is the largest English-language network that is wholly responsible for handling programming on behalf of its affiliates, some of which run limited locally produced public affairs and religious programming. It has around 70 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations, the majority of which are owned by parent Ion Media Networks through its TV stations group, Ion Media Television); Ion is available in markets without an over-the-air (OTA) affiliate via a national feed that is distributed to cable and satellite providers. As Pax TV and i, it aired several hours a week of original programming in primetime (often produced in conjunction with NBC). Ion owned-and-operated stations and some affiliates also carry two sister multicast services on their digital subchannels, children's network Qubo (which handles most of the federally required educational programming content for the network's stations) and lifestyle-oriented Ion Life, with many of the network's O&Os also carrying QVC and the Home Shopping Network on additional subchannels.

Minor and digital multicast networks[edit]

Nomenclatures for commercial networks[edit]
Nicknames referring to the major American networks (most established by the industry publication Variety as "slanguage") are as follows:

ABC: "Alphabet network" (its name is also the first three letters of the alphabet) or "circle network" (the network's logo, used since 1962, is a circle with its initials in lower-case)
CBS: "Tiffany network" or "eye network" (for the network's high-toned reputation and eye logo, respectively)
Fox Broadcasting Company: referred to by media outlets and by the network itself by the capitalized "FOX", and the legal name is only used in industry media and legal documents
NBC: "Peacock network" (after its multi-colored logo)
The CW: "Green network" (the color scheme originally used by the network for its on-air imaging was dominated by the color green)
MyNetworkTV: "Fox mini-network" (like Fox, the network was formed by News Corporation)
PBS: "Head Network" (in reference to the network's educational programming, mascot, and logo)
UPN (defunct): "Used Parts Network" (for its acquisitions of series formerly seen on other networks to broadcast new episodes), "Shapes network" or "Disc network" (after the network's 1995 to 2002 and 2002 to 2006 logos)

Additionally, both The WB and UPN were referred to as "weblets" by Variety, because of their smaller audiences and reduced program schedules. The CW and MyNetworkTV have more often been called "netlets," which utilizes the same definition.
Spanish-language commercial networks[edit]

Univisión – The flagship property of corporate parent Univision Communications, Univision was formed in 1986 following the sale of predecessor Spanish International Network (SIN) to Hallmark from Mexican broadcaster Televisa due to federal laws that restrict foreign ownership of U.S. TV networks. The network airs a mix of telenovelas, news and variety programming (either produced by the network or sourced primarily from Televisa), as well as soccer events and occasional Mexican-imported feature films. It is the nation's largest commercial Spanish-language network, with approximately 120 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations (including over 50 full-power stations); Univision is available in markets without an over-the-air affiliate via a national feed (east and west channels) that is distributed to cable and satellite providers. Most of its stations produce and/or broadcast local newscasts, usually limited to weekday evening time slots in most markets. Since the mid-2000s, Univision has ranked as the fifth highest-rated commercial network overall on average, currently placing ahead of English language competitor The CW.[23]

The nation's second-largest commercial Spanish-language network, Telemundo has over 100 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations (including approximately 40 full-power stations); it is also available in Mexico and Puerto Rico (where it was founded in 1954 as the brand name for WKAQ-TV). Most Telemundo stations air local newscasts, primarily aired in evening timeslots, although some affiliates also produce public affairs programming. Telemundo is available in markets without an over-the-air affiliate via a national feed (east and west channels) that is distributed to cable and satellite providers.
Azteca (originally known as Azteca América from 2001 to 2014) – Azteca is a general entertainment network owned by Azteca International Corporation, featuring programming primarily sourced from the Mexican Azteca networks (though much of the American network's programming airs at different times), along with original and imported programming from other U.S. and Latin American distributors; it carries a mix of telenovelas, feature films (both dubbed and natively produced in Spanish), sports, news and variety programming. Azteca maintains nearly 90 affiliates (including eight full-power stations), and is the nation's fourth-largest commercial Spanish-language network.

The network was launched in 2009, featuring programming originally produced for the Liberman-owned Spanish language independent stations that formed the nucleus of the network. Estrella TV maintains nearly 35 owned-and-operated and affiliate stations (most of which are owned by Liberman or carry the network as a subchannel-only affiliation), and is the fifth-largest commercial Spanish-language network; it is also available nationally on select cable providers.
Multimedios Televisión – Multimedios is a general entertainment network based out of Monterrey, Nuevo León which features mainly live studio variety programming and news, and is a major regional network in Northeastern Mexico which also features several stations along the Southern Texas border, and tailors their programming (and through local stations, news programming) to both Mexican and American viewers. The network is distributed through several separately owned over-the-air affiliates in the U.S. mainly in the Southwest and southern Texas, and nationally through cable providers and DirecTV.
LATV – LATV is a bilingual general entertainment network owned by LATV Networks, LLC; originated as a programming format on KJLA in Los Angeles, the network's lone owned-and-operated station, it became a national network in 2007.

Additionally, Televisa, which distributes programming to Univision in the United States, operates in Mexico, but the company's networks (Canal de las Estrellas, Canal 5 and Gala TV) have certain stations which can be received in parts of the U.S. located along and near the Mexican border, and likewise with the American networks have affiliates located or receivable in Mexican border cities. Some Mexican border stations (such as the no longer broadcasting CW affiliate XETV-TDT in Tijuana) who formerly maintained affiliations with U.S.-based English or Spanish networks, but mainly targeted their programming at their American border city (more than the Mexican metropolitan area that they are based in or merely licensed to).
Although the English-language programming model in the U.S. traditionally relies on the network and its stations handling programming responsibilities, Spanish language networks handle most of the responsibility for programming, while affiliates are limited to breakaways from the network feed to provide local news, public affairs and/or entertainment programming as well as local advertising. As such, all Spanish language networks primarily available on broadcast TV operate national feeds that are distributed to cable and satellite providers in markets without a local affiliate. Spanish-language independent stations also exist, though (particularly with the launch of Estrella TV), these are very limited and mainly exist in large markets.

^ a b c Although ABC, NBC, and CBS were founded prior to 1941, those companies did not begin continuous over the air TV broadcasting until 1941 (NBC and CBS) and 1948 (ABC).
^ a b DuMont's relationship with the Fox network via Metromedia is disputed, with Fox being either a modern re-incarnation, or at least a linear descendant of the DuMont Television Network (via former DuMont subsidiary Metromedia)
^ a b On January 24, 2006, CBS and Time Warner announced the merger of The WB and UPN, forming one larger network, The CW in late 2006. See The CW for more information. The CW and MyNetworkTV are also carried on cable-only channels and digital subchannels of many currently operating television stations of several different affiliations, ranging from current WB and Fox affiliates, to even NBC and CBS affiliates. The WB and UPN shut down on September 18, 2006 to merge into The CW. MyNetworkTV was created by the Fox Broadcasting Company to give programming to several Fox-owned UPN affiliates, upon the shutdown of UPN. MyNetworkTV transitioned from a commercial network to a syndication service in 2009.
^ Although PBS was initially established in 1969, it assumed full-time broadcasts on October 5, 1970 to replace its predecessor, National Educational Television (NET).

^ Jewelry Television has around three direct affiliates; most other stations carrying its programming are indirectly affiliated with the network through Shop at Home.
^ Prior to its shutdown in 2008, Shop at Home only broadcast its programming overnights, and thus full-time affiliates of the network carried Jewelry Television during the daytime hours.
