History[edit]
The pilot episode of Talking Smack aired on August 2, 2016 on the WWE Network, immediately after WWE Smackdown and served as both a recap of the preceding episode of Smackdown and a talk show featuring interviews with various members of the Smackdown Live roster, conducted by Renee Young and her co-host, most often Daniel Bryan. Starting on October 9, 2016, Talking Smack began airing after Smackdown Live exclusive pay-per-views as well as weekly episodes of Smackdown Live.
After the introduction of WWE 205 Live, which debuted on November 29, 2016, immediately following Smackdown on the WWE Network, Talking Smack was moved from it's usual 10:00pm EST slot to air at 11:00pm EST, immediately following 205 Live.[2]
In July 2017, Talking Smack was removed from Tuesday nights altogether, and instead became exclusive to Smackdown Live pay-per-views, starting with Battleground on July 23, 2017.[3]
