Programming[edit]
Main article: List of programs broadcast by GMA Life TV
The programming of GMA Pinoy TV consists mostly of shows from the Philippines from GMA Network and GMA News TV as well as previously aired shows, documentaries, films, and sports events from the Philippines. The delay of GMA Pinoy TV's and GMA Life TV's dramas all air on one-episode delay basis. Most weekend shows are up to date, with the exception of some shows that air on a one-episode delay basis.

In September 2010, GMA Life TV has 122,000 subscribers while its sister channel, GMA Pinoy TV has a total of 256,000 subscribers. This is based on a report that the Corporate Communications Department of GMA Network has posted.[2]
Recently, as of 3rd Quarter of 2010, GMA Life TV has around 126,000 subscribers. The number of subscribers began to substantially increase when the channel was launched during the early part of this year in other areas such us Florida (via Brighhouse Tampa), Texas (via En-Touch), Hong Kong (via PCCW), and Central California (via Comcast).[3]
2011[edit]
By 2011, GMA Life TV will air re-runs of previous GMA shows as QTV will be re-formatted into GMA News TV. GMA News TV will also be available in the worldwide market.[4][5]
This did occur from 20 February 2011 onward, the decision was to run movies temporarily in place of the previously aired programs from the now-ceased QTV.
On 28 February 2011 for the first time in GMA Worldwide, Inc. history, two programs that started airing on GMA Pinoy TV that is still running with new episodes was switched over to GMA Life TV, where it will then air its new episodes, to occupy free time slots. This then led to replays of other Kapuso shows. The shows included Pinoy MD and Love ni Mister, Love ni Misis. All this will be straightened out once GMA News TV starts its international operations sometime 2nd to 3rd Quarter of 2011.
In a report published showing GMA Network's revenues for 2010 with a total of PhP 14.299 Billion, GMA Life TV has 125,000 subscribers (an estimated 800,000 viewers count) while GMA Pinoy TV has an accounted 273,000 subscribers (around 1.8 Million viewers).[6][7]

In a recent report, dated 16 May 2011, regarding the consolidated gross revenues of GMA Network, Inc. in the first quarter of 2011, it is noted that GMA Pinoy TV's subscriptions grew by 10 percent (approximately 300,000 subscribers) and GMA Life TV's subscriptions grew by 2 percent (approximately 128,000), respectively. This consisted of PhP 230 million worth of advertising and subscription revenues.[8]
And in May/June 2011, GMA Pinoy TV/GMA Life TV sent many of its artists to various places worldwide, it's the first time that Kapuso artists were sent almost consecutively, to celebrate Philippine Independence Day/Filipino Culture Fiestas and to promote GMA Pinoy TV/GMA Life TV and its shows. They consisted of Iza Calzado & Dennis Trillo who went to Hawaii on 7 May 2011, then on 28 May 2011, Jolina Magdangal and JayR visited National City in San Diego, CA. On the 113th Philippine Independence Day proper, Dennis Trillo & Iza Calzado were sent this time to Hong Kong to represent GMA Pinoy TV and perform there and in Singapore, Dingdong Dantes and Rachel Ann Go were present. And on 26 June 2011, Aljur Abrenica, Jennylyn Mercado, Iza Calzado and Mark Bautista will be sent to be part of Philippine-American Friendship Day in Jersey City, New Jersey.[9][10][11]
In another recent report with regards to GMA Network's consolidated revenues in the 2nd quarter of 2011, GMA Pinoy TV's subscribers grew to 279,000 from 274,000 (actual count) and an estimated amount of 1.85 million viewers and GMA Life TV's subscribers grew as well, an estimated 1 million viewers. Also, GMA Network recently launched GMA News TV in the past month and will be made available to all areas where GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV reaches by 3rd Quarter of 2011. GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV were further made to subscribers in key Filipino-American areas in the US, namely New Jersey, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and Washington DC. They were also launched in many parts of Detroit, Hawaii and upstate New York and New England. The channels were also launched by additional carriers in Australia and Papua New Guinea.[12]
On 22 September 2011, GMA Life TV will air two previously-aired GMA programs dubbed in English, they are Una Kang Naging Akin to be renamed in English as When You Were Mine and Impostora to be renamed Impostor. This is the first time that GMA's dramas will be dubbed and re-aired in English.[citation needed]
2012[edit]
In a press statement released by GMA Network, Inc., it is stated that GMA Life TV, as of 1st Quarter of 2012, has approximately 117,000 subscribers, which amounts to nearly 1.2 million viewers.[13][14][15]
For the first time in GMA history, Idol sa Kusina, a program originally aired on QTV then GMA News TV and is simulcasted on GMA Life TV moves to GMA Pinoy TV on 14 July 2012.
2013[edit]
SingTel mio TV will launch this channel with effect from 14 June 2013 at 00:00 hrs SST.
On 22 December 2013 GMA Life TV started airing its first Tagalog-dubbed Koreanovela, Full House, followed by A Rosy Life on 20 January 2014.
2014[edit]
On 13 March 2014 GMA Life TV began airing its third Tagalog-dubbed Koreanovela Sassy Girl, followed by Cruel Love on 7 April 2014 and Dal-ja's Spring on 14 April 2014.
Basta Every Day, Happy! was supposed to premiere on 12 May 2014 (in some territories like the US on the evening of 11 May 2014) and air throughout its entire duration on GMA Pinoy TV but the programming department of GMA International, GMA's international subsidiary, decided to move the show over to GMA Life TV as it adheres more to GMA Life TV's overall theme as a lifestyle channel as well as the show is a replacement for Kusina Master, so the programming department had seen that the move was done rightfully so. On 30 June 2014, A Rosy Life re-airs for the second time on GMA Life TV, followed by the second re-run of Sassy Girl on 22 September 2014 and Cruel Love on 17 November 2014.
