List of public-access TV stations in the United States (Rhode Island–Texas) - Wikipedia


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

In the United States, every community that is served by one or more cable TV companies has the right to collect a Cable television franchise fee, based on the Cable Communications Act of 1984 Section 622, from those cable companies to fund a public-access television cable TV channel. In addition, the cable television companies must make public, educational, and government access (PEG) channels available for the public-access organization to distribute the locally originated Nonprofit organization's programming produced by or made available to the organization.[citation needed]
This list was initiated based on a list of public-access stations listed by Alliance for Community Media (ACM), with some defunct organizations removed. The distribution of organizations here does not always correlate to population; for example, although California has the most stations listed, Michigan and Minnesota each have more stations than New York.
Charter Type: P = Public-access television E = Educational-access television G = Government-access television Florida Tampa Bay Community Network, a service of Speak Up Tampa Bay Public Access Television, Inc., a 501c3 non-profit organization, airs on Verizon 30 and 36, Bright House Networks 949 and 950 and Comcast 20 -- as well as streams from watchus.tbcn.org. Viewer universe is 926,000.
