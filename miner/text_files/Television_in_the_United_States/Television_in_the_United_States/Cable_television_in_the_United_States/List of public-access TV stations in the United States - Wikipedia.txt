In the United States, every community that is served by one or more cable TV companies has the right to collect a cable television franchise fee, based on the Cable Communications Act of 1984 Section 622, from those cable companies to fund a Public-access television cable TV channel. In addition, if desired by the municipality, the cable television companies must make Public, educational, and government access (PEGA) channels available for the public access entity to distribute the local programming.[citation needed]
This list was initiated based on a list of public-access stations collected by Alliance for Community Media (ACM), with some defunct organizations removed. The distribution of organizations here does not always correlate to population; for example, although California has the most stations listed, Michigan and Minnesota each have more stations than New York.
Charter Type: P = Public-access television E = Educational-access television G = Government-access television
