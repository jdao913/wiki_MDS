History[edit]
In 2006 SomosTV, a media company based in Miami, Fl announced the launch of ViendoMovies then under the name VeneMovies.[1] At the time of launch, the channel was considered one of the first 24-hour Hispanic cable movie channels in the United States. ViendoMovies was created based on the Hispanic market's need for Spanish language quality films. U.S. Hispanics are aggressive consumers of film entertainment. According to Hispanics Business Magazine, Hispanics eagerly attend film openings, accounting for over 17% of tickets sold and watch more movies (DVDs, Blu-ray, and Digital Streaming) per year than any other segment of the U.S. population.[2] On July 4, 2011, VeneMovies was renamed ViendoMovies.
Current events[edit]
ViendoMovies is currently distributed by all the major cable companies including Comcast, Time Warner, CenturyLink, Cablevision, DirectTV, Charter Communications, RCN, Verizon, FIOS, AT&T U-Verse, Choice Cable and Liberty Cablevision (both in Puerto Rico), Innovative Cable U.S. Virgin Islands and other cable companies. The channel continues to expand its presence in the U.S. and in 2014 announced National Satellite Distribution.[3][4][5][6]
Programming[edit]
According to PRNewsWire, ViendoMovies offers a selection of award-winning movies from Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, among others. The channel includes popular genres such as action, drama, comedies, romance, etc. and include a free VOD (Video on Demand) offering for its subscribers, plus coverage of national and international film festivals where Spanish language movies participate.[5]
ViendoMovies is affiliated as well to NCTC (National Cable Television Cooperative) for cable operators. NCTC is responsible for acquiring programming and hardware for almost 1000 affiliated companies that own and operate cable systems in the U.S.[7]
