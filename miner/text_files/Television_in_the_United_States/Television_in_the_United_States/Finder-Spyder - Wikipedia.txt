Finder-Spyder is a fictional brand of Web search engine that appears in numerous, otherwise unaffiliated television shows, used in the same manner as the fictitious 555 telephone number in TV and film.[1][2] Its graphic appearance varies, at times bearing a similarity to Google.[1] It has been called "an unofficial, open source stand-in for Google and its competitors" (used as a legality-free alternative to a brand-name product),[1] and "the most popular search engine in the TV universe."[3] Finder-Spyder is a regular top 10 pick in "best fictional brand" lists by various online media, along with Oceanic Airlines, Morley cigarettes, Acme Corporation, and others.[4][5][6]
Finder-Spyder offers search engines for Web, images, news, forums, and blogs, also, Phone Trace, a for-a-fee reverse phone number lookup tool.[7]
