Production[edit]
The series was first announced in October 1990. The first season was co-produced by RAI and First Group International, a production company founded by Spencer's son Giuseppe Pedersoli. The second season was co-produced by Mediaset. Over the years, reruns have appeared on Channel 4, La7 and satellite channels RaiSat Premium and Sky Movies.
Plot[edit]
Jack Costello (Bud Spencer) is a retired cop and now private detective who lives in Miami, who handles a myriad of cases for unusual clients. At his side are old police buddy Sam Bosley (Lou Bedford) and cartoonist-turned-amateur sleuth Jean Philippe Dumas (Philip Michael Thomas), who is using Costello as an influence and has nicknamed the burly detective "Extralarge." In the second series, Costello faces other dangerous cases, again with Bosley and Archibad (Michael Winslow), the son of an old friend, who Costello amusingly nicknames "Dumas."
