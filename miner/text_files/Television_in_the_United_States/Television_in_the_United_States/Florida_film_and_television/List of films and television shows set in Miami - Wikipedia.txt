Context[edit]
Because of its climate and the high sunshine amounts, Florida has long been a favoured location for filmmakers, and the early silent film industry in the state rivaled Hollywood's in production.[citation needed] Film in Florida is still a major industry in the state, with Florida ranking third in the U.S. for film production (after California and New York, respectively) based on revenue generated (according to 2006 Florida Film Commission Data[citation needed]). In particular, Miami has long been a popular filming location in Florida and continues to grow as the entertainment industry expands throughout the state.[citation needed]
Worldwide, Miami is one of the largest production and distribution centers for commercial advertising, film, music, new media, still photography, and television industries. The industry's[which?] combined economic impact in the local economy is about two billion dollars annually, with $100 to $150 million coming from more than 1,000 location filming shoots each year.[when?][citation needed] There are approximately 3,000 companies working in film and entertainment in Miami-Dade County, employing an estimated 15,000 workers.[citation needed]
Spanish-language productions[edit]

Miami's large Hispanic population and close proximity to Latin America have made Miami a center for Latin television and film production. As a result, many Spanish-language programs are filmed in Miami's numerous television production studios, predominantly in Hialeah and Doral. These include game shows, news programs, reality shows, telenovelas, and variety shows.
