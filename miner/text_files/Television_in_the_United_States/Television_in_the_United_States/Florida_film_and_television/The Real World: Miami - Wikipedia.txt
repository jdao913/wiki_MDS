The Real World: Miami is the fifth season of MTV's reality television series The Real World, which focuses on a group of diverse strangers living together for several months in a different city each season, as cameras follow their lives and interpersonal relationships. It is the first season of The Real World to be filmed in the South Atlantic States region of the United States, specifically in Florida.
The season featured seven people who lived in a house on Rivo Alto Island and was the first season filmed in the United States outside of New York and California. Production for the season started from February to July 1996. This is the first of two seasons filmed in Florida. Ten years later, the show set its seventeenth season, The Real World: Key West returning to the state in the Key Haven neighborhood of Key West. The season premiered on July 10 of that year, consisted of 22 episodes.

Season changes[edit]
This was the first season in which the housemates were given a season-long assignment or task, an aspect of the series that would continue in almost all subsequent seasons (the Brooklyn and D.C. seasons dispensed with it). This season the cast was given $50,000 startup money to begin a business of their choosing. The cast's efforts were marked by much disorganization and conflict, and while ideas such as a dessert delivery service and a fashion line were floated about, they were ultimately not able to start the business.
The residence[edit]
The house is located at 445 E Rivo Alto Dr, in Miami Beach, just north of the Venetian Causeway on affluent Rivo Alto Island. The four bedroom, three bathroom house is on 3⁄10 acre (1,214 m2) of land, and is 4,976 square feet (462.3 m2). Its current owner is former Ford CEO Jacques Nasser.[2]
