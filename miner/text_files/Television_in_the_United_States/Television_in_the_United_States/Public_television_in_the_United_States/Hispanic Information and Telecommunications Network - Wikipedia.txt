The Hispanic Information and Telecommunications Network, Inc. (HITN) is a television channel that was established in 1983 as a private, non-profit organization to create a network of non-commercial telecommunications facilities to advance the educational, social, cultural, and economic circumstances of Hispanics.[1]
HITN-TV, established in 1983, is a branch of HITN and provides non-commercial Spanish-language educational programming in the United States. Currently, it is carried on Direct TV, DISH Network, AT&T U-verse TV, Verizon FiOS TV, and in designated markets on Time Warner Cable, Comcast Cable and Charter Communications. It offers educational, enriching, and empowering non-original content to the fastest growing ethnic group in the US. Some programs are broadcast in English.
HITN's commitment to education is manifested in multiple programs and projects, including HITN Learning, an online, bilingual (English – Spanish) educational program that delivers innovative content aligned to the Common Core State Standards in English/Language Arts and Mathematics for grades 3-6.
Project LAMP, part of the U.S. Department of Education’s Ready To Learn program, is designed to help close the “achievement gap” of low-income children by creating multi-platform digital media-based programs for children ages three-to-eight years old to better prepare them for school and success as lifelong learners.
HITN is also the largest holder of Educational Broadband Spectrum (EBS) in the US, supporting the next generation of wireless broadband networks and creating new opportunities to deliver educational content and connect communities. Most of the EBS Spectrum held by HITN is leased to companies such as Clearwire.[2]
