ITVS (Independent Television Service) is a service in the United States which funds and presents documentaries on public television through distribution by PBS and American Public Television, new media projects on the Internet, and the weekly series Independent Lens[1] on PBS. Some ITVS programs are produced along with organizations like Latino Public Broadcasting and KQED.
ITVS was established through legislation by the United States Congress in 1988,[2][3] “to expand the diversity and innovativeness of programming available to public broadcasting,”[4] and began funding new programming via production licensing agreements[5] in 1990. From 2005-2010, it expanded its reach through the creation of the Global Perspectives Project, which facilitated the international exchange of documentary films made by independent producers. ITVS is funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), and is based in San Francisco. In 2017, ITVS was named the recipient of a Peabody Institutional Award for its contributions to storytelling in television; the Peabody board of jurors cited "an accomplished range of work as rich as any broadcaster or funder,"[6] and in the same year the organization learned it was to receive the 2017 Emmy Governors Award chosen by the Television Academy Board of Governors, awarded during the Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony on Saturday, September 9, 2017.[7]
