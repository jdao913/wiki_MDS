Duhamel Broadcasting Tower Angora is a tall guyed mast located at Angora, Nebraska. Duhamel Broadcasting Tower Angora was completed in 2003 and is 1,478 feet (450.5 m) high.
The tower serves as the broadcasting platform for the Duhamel-owned TV stations KDUH-TV 4/DT 7 in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, which is 30 miles (50 kilometers) away.
The tower was built as a replacement for their 599-meter tower near Hemingford, Nebraska, which collapsed in 2002, killing two tower workers and injuring three.
