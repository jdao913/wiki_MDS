KOBR-TV Tower (also called KSWS-TV Tower) is a 490.7 meter (1,610 ft) high guy-wired aerial mast supporting the transmission antenna of television station KOBR in Caprock, New Mexico, United States. KOBR-TV Tower was built during 1960. The original KSWS-TV Tower was built during 1956 December and was the same height at 1610 ft. It was the world's tallest structure, surpassing previous record-holder KWTV's tower until the completion of WGME-TV Tower in Maine during 1959 September. During 1960, the original tower reportedly fell in a gale or ice storm[citation needed].
