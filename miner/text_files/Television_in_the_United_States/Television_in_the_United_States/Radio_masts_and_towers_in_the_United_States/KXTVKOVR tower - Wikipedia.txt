The KXTV/KOVR Tower is a guyed communication tower in Walnut Grove, California, United States, which rises to 2,049 feet (624.5 m) in height from sea level.
Built in 1986, it is the tallest structure in California, the third-tallest guyed mast in the world (as of 2001), and the seventh tallest structure to have ever existed if the destroyed Warsaw radio mast, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, and the Tokyo Sky Tree in Tokyo are included.
Omni-directional TV transmitters on the tower carry the over-the-air (OTA) broadcast signals for KXTV-TV channel 10 (virtual and transmit) and KOVR-TV channel 13 (virtual) and 25 (transmit). The geographical coordinates for the site, a low-lying rural area about 23 miles south-southwest of Sacramento and 25 miles north-northwest of Stockton, are 38°14′23″N 121°30′06″W﻿ / ﻿38.23972°N 121.50167°W﻿ / 38.23972; -121.50167Coordinates: 38°14′23″N 121°30′06″W﻿ / ﻿38.23972°N 121.50167°W﻿ / 38.23972; -121.50167.
In the neighborhood of KXTV/KOVR Tower are two towers of similar height, the Channel 40 and KVIE-TV Channel 6 Tower and the Channel 3-Hearst-Argyle Tower, forming an impressive antenna "farm" on the east side of the Sacramento River and west of the Interstate 5 freeway, which can be easily seen for miles around in every direction.
The transmitters on these towers serve broadcast stations airing programming to TV viewers in the Sacramento/Stockton/Modesto DMA (Designated Market Area)[1] (Designated Market Area) in California's Central Valley.
With their significant height and central location in Walnut Grove, they provide line-of-sight (LOS)[2] signal coverage to the adjacent flat valley terrain for over 60 miles (100 kilometers) to the north (Sacramento) and to the south-southeast (Stockton and Modesto). The towers also provide quite good coverage across the valley to the east into the Sierra Nevada foothills and mountains, and to the west to portions of the eastern San Francisco Bay Area (eastern Solano and Contra Costa counties).[3]
