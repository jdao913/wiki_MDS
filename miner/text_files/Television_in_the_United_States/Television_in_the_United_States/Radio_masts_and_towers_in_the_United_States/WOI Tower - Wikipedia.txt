The WOI Tower (also called NYT Broadcast Holdings Tower, for WHO-TV's former owner) is a 609.6-meter (2,000 ft) high guy-wired mast located in Alleman, Iowa, United States, north of the Des Moines urban area, at 41°48′33″N 93°36′54″W﻿ / ﻿41.80917°N 93.61500°W﻿ / 41.80917; -93.61500. It carries not only the signal of ABC affiliate WOI-TV (channel 5), but also NBC affiliate WHO-TV (channel 13), and PBS member station KDIN (channel 11) as well as NPR member station WOI-FM (90.1). The structure is one of the very few masts to have elevators.
The tower was completed in 1972 and is property of Tribune Broadcasting, the owner of WHO-TV, Iowa Public Television and Iowa State University.
