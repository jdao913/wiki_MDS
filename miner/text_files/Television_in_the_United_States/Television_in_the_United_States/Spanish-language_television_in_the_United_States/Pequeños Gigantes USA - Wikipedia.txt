Pequeños Gigantes USA (English: Small Giants USA) is a Spanish-language reality talent show that originally premiered in United States on February 6, 2017, on Univision.[1] The show is hosted by Giselle Blondet,[2] with Sebastián Villalobos as digital reporter.
The talent show televises six teams of talented children from the United States and Puerto Rico (each group comprises three or four children and a celebrity captain) competing against each other to receive the highest ranking at the end of each week, and for the first place and the grand prize. Each group is divided into three categories: extraordinary talent, singing, and dancing. In each group there is one child who has an extraordinary talent, one singer, and one or two dancers.
Three judges give each child category a rating based from 1 to 5. The judges consist of Mexican theater-actress Bianca Marroquín, regional Mexican singer Luis Coronel, and American singer Prince Royce.[3]
On May 12, 2017 Univision confirmed that the show would be renewed for a second season.[4]
