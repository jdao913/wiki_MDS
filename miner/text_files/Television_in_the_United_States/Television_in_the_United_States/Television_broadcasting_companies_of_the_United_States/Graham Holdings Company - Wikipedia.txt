Corporate history[edit]
The history of Graham Holdings Company dates back to 1877, when the Post was first published. The Washington Post Company was incorporated in the District of Columbia in 1889,[2] and remained a District of Columbia corporation until it changed its place of incorporation to Delaware in 2003.[3] It is a public company and its Class B common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GHC; it went public in 1971.
Descendents of the late Eugene Meyer (including Chairman and CEO Donald E. Graham, his sister Lally Weymouth, and the beneficiaries of various family trusts) collectively control the company through their ownership of the unlisted Class A common stock that selects 70% of the company's board of directors. As of 2014, it forms more than 90% of the family's assets.[4] Prior to 2014, Berkshire Hathaway was a substantial holder of the public Class B common stock that selects 30% of the company's board of directors, but exchanged most of that stock for WPLG-TV, one of Graham Holdings' television stations, and other assets, in 2014.[4]
2013 sale of The Washington Post[edit]
On August 5, 2013 it was announced that the Washington Post Company would sell the flagship newspaper for $250 million to Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon.com. The Washington Post Company agreed to adopt a new corporate name once the sale was finalized. It adopted Graham Holdings Company as the new name effective November 29, 2013.[5] Amazon.com was not involved in the sale.[6] Nash Holdings LLC, a company owned by Bezos, closed the purchase of the newspaper and affiliated publications on October 1, 2013.[7][8] Graham Holdings Company retained ownership of WaPo Labs, its technology innovation group,[9] since rebranded as Trove.
Since 1950, the company had been based in the Washington Post building in Washington, D.C., which was sold off separately in 2014. Its new headquarters are at 1300 North 17th Street in Arlington, Virginia, with the choice of state motivated (according to Don Graham) by the proximity to Congress and the fact that two of the holding's activity areas, education and health care, are subject to federal regulation.[4]
In 2014, Tim O'Shaughnessy joined GHC as president, the founder of LivingSocial and a son-in-law of CEO Don Graham.[4] Tim O'Shaughnessy became CEO in November 2015.
Education[edit]
The Education area yielded 61% of GHC's revenue in 2014.[4] Kaplan, Inc. is one of the world's largest providers of educational services.[citation needed] Kaplan focuses on three areas: higher education, professional training, and test preparation. Headquartered in New York City, Kaplan had $2.2 billion in revenue in 2013.[10]
StudentAdvisor.com is the latest[when?] education resource launched by Graham Holdings Company. StudentAdvisor.com is an education research (reviews written by students, alumni, and parents) and comparison destination (tools to download and compare multiple colleges) for students, parents, and lifetime learners.
In January 2016, Graham Holdings launched CyberVista, a cybersecurity training and education company.[11]
Broadcasting[edit]
