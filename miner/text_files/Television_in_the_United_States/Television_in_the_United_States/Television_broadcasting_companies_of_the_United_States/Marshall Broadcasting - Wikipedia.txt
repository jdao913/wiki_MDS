Marshall Broadcasting Group, Inc. is a television broadcasting company that owns three full power television stations in the United States. The company was founded in 2014 by Pluria Marshall, Jr. All three of its television stations are affiliated with the Fox and are operated through shared services agreements by the Nexstar Media Group.
In 2014, Nexstar Broadcasting Group acquired the stock of television operators Grant Broadcasting, Communications Corporation of America, and White Knight Broadcasting. Due to FCC ownership limits, Nexstar sold former Grant station KLJB in Davenport, Iowa, and former ComCorp stations KPEJ-TV in Odessa, Texas and KMSS-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana, all three of which are Fox affiliates, to Marshall Broadcasting. Nexstar operates all three of the television stations owned by Marshall Broadcasting through a shared services agreement, providing non-programming resources to the stations such as master control, advertising sales, and engineering support.[1][2]
