History[edit]
Raycom's three founding owners were Stephen Burr (a Boston lawyer), Ken Hawkins (general manager) and William Zortman (news director) with funding from Retirement Systems of Alabama.[3] In the second quarter 1996, Raycom purchased for over $700 million Ellis Communications' broadcasting stations, 15 television and two radio,[3] plus Bert Ellis's Raycom Sports.[2] In mid-year 1996, the company agreed to purchase from Federal Enterprises Inc. of suburban Detroit for $160 million eight station in the Southeast and the Midwest.[3] Raycom bought Aflac's broadcast division of five TV stations in August 1996 mainly using a loan from the RSA.[3][4] The three groups merged to form Raycom Media. John Hayes initially headed up the company until 2001.[2]
Raycom took a 35% stake in Worldnow, an internet publishing provider for broadcast media, in 1998.[2]:2 In 1998, Raycom purchased Malrite Communications, owner of five stations, two Puerto Rico stations, three Ohio stations, and one Florida station.[5]
In 2001, Paul McTear took over as Raycom’s president and CEO from Hayes.[2]:2 Raycom sold a dozen of its stations to Barrington Broadcasting in August 2006.[6] On January 31, 2006, the company acquired the Liberty Corporation[7] Raycom agreed to affiliated its NBC stations' subchannel with NBC Weather Plus,[8] a joint venture between the affiliates and NBC station group.[9]
In April 2005, Raycom was testing The Tube Music Network on station WFLX-TV, a Fox affiliate, for three weeks. Raycom then announced on April 25, 2005, it was the launch station group for The Tube affiliating 29 stations.[8] Raycom launched the network in June 2005 on 30 stations with Cleveland being the largest market.[10] Raycom Media was an initial round investor in The Tube Music Network.[11]
On November 12, 2007, Raycom announced its intention to acquire some of the television broadcasting properties of Lincoln National Corporation's Lincoln Financial Media—three television stations (see table below), plus Lincoln Financial Sports—for $583 million.[12] Lincoln Financial Sports was merged into Raycom Sports later that year.[13] The purchase of the stations were completed on April 2, 2008.[14]
Around 2010, Raycom moved into producing its own program due to dissatisfaction in sign up for two years for unscripted syndicated programming usually without a pilot. Scripps, Cox and Raycom partnered for the Magic Dust production of Right This Minute that launched in 2011. The company on its own launched America Now, a lifestyle-oriented news magazine, in 2011. The show that had a limited budget and could not get carriage outside Raycom stations. The magazine lasted until September 2014. In partnership with Bellum Entertainment Group in 2014, Flip My Food and Fix It and Finish It were launched as strips as lead in to Raycom early newscasts. In third quarter 2014, Raycom purchased RTM Productions, based in Nashville and produces PowerNation branded auto-oriented shows for SpikeTV and NBC and CBS sports networks.[2]:2 Raycom acquired the assets of live and studio sports programming production company Tupelo-Honey Productions in January 2012.[15]
In 2011, Raycom was an initial investor in Bounce TV, a broadcast subchannel network.[16]1 Raycom News Network Digital Hub, an online news aggregator and exchange, was started in 2011 at the company main office in Montgomery, Alabama.[2]:2 Raycom Media was an initial investors in Katz Broadcasting, launched in 2014 and a Bounce affiliated subchannel network group.[16]
On November 20, 2013, Raycom entered into a shared services agreement to operate Louisiana Media Company's WVUE-TV in New Orleans.[17]
On August 10, 2015, Raycom announced that it would purchase stations owned by Drewry Communications for $160 million.[18] The sale was completed on December 1, 2015.[19]
Raycom acquired Indianapolis-based sports production company WebStream Sports on September 14, 2015.[20] WebStream was subsequently merged with existing Raycom entity Tupelo Honey to form Tupelo Raycom in January 2016.[21]
In October 2015, Raycom acquired Fox affiliate KNIN-TV for $14.5 million from Scripps Media; the FCC required that the station be divested during Scripps' acquisition of Journal Communications, but Scripps entered into shared services agreements with Raycom to continue operating KNIN.[22]
Raycom purchased PureCars, a digital ad platform focused on automotive sales, for $125 million in November 2015.[23]
On April 4, 2017, Raycom reached an agreement to acquire WVUE outright.[24]
In May 2017, Raycom Media purchased Calkins Media's WWSB and WTXL-TV. A sale of Calkins' WAAY-TV to Raycom affiliate American Spirit Media was blocked by the Department of Justice due to Raycom's ownership of WAFF-TV, and was instead sold to Heartland Media.[25] The deal increased Raycom's reach to 16% of U.S. television households.[26]
On September 25, 2017, Raycom announced that it would merge with Community Newspaper Holdings (CNHI), which is also principally owned by Retirement Systems of Alabama. CNHI will contine to operate as a subsidiary of Raycom. To comply with FCC newspaper cross-ownership restrictions, Raycom will divest newspapers in the seven markets where CNHI and Raycom both own properties.[27][28][29]
