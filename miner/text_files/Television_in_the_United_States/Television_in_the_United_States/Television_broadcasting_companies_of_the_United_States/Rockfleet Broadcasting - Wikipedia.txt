Rockfleet Broadcasting is a broadcasting company based in New York City. The company has three stations in its family.
A fourth station is no longer under Rockfleet ownership. On May 10, 2007, it was announced that Rockfleet Broadcasting was planning to sell Fox affiliate WFQX-TV to Cadillac Telecasting. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale in late-October. After this approval, Cadillac entered into a shared services agreement (SSA) with Heritage Broadcasting Group (owner of CBS affiliate WWTV). At that point, WFQX began to be operated by WWTV.
