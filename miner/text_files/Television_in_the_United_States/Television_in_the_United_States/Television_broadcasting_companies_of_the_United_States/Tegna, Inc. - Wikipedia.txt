Tegna, Inc. (stylized as TEGNA) is an American publicly traded broadcast, digital media and marketing services company headquartered in McLean, Virginia.[2] It was created on June 29, 2015, when the Gannett Company split into two publicly traded companies. Tegna comprised the more profitable broadcast television and digital media divisions of the old Gannett, while Gannett's publishing interests were spun off as a "new" company that retained the Gannett name. Tegna owns or operates 46 television stations in 38 markets, and is the largest group owner of stations affiliated with NBC and CBS and the fourth-largest group owner of stations affiliated with ABC and holds properties in digital media.

History[edit]
In June 2015, Gannett split into two independent publicly traded companies, one focusing on its newspapers and publishing, which would retain the Gannett name, and one on broadcasting. Robert Dickey – who led Gannett's newspaper group – would serve as CEO of the former company, leaving the remaining broadcasting and digital operations under the leadership of Gracia Martore. In a statement, she explained that the split plans were "significant next steps in our ongoing initiatives to increase shareholder value by building scale, increasing cash flow, sharpening management focus, and strengthening all of our businesses to compete effectively in today's increasingly digital landscape." Additionally, the company announced that it would buy out the remainder of Classified Ventures (a joint venture between Tegna and several other media companies) for $1.8 billion, giving it full ownership of properties such as Cars.com.[3][4]
As part of the separation, the company announced that the broadcasting and digital company would be named Tegna—a partial anagram of "Gannett".[5] The spin-out was structured so that Tegna is the legal successor to the "old" Gannett, while the "new" Gannett is legally considered a new company. The split was completed on June 29, 2015. Tegna retained "old" Gannett's stock price history, though it trades under a new ticker symbol, TGNA. The "new" Gannett inherited old Gannett's longtime ticker symbol, GCI.[6]
Tegna also retained G/O Digital, a digital marketing services brand that it launched in August 2013, and the 20 broadcast stations it acquired from Belo Corporation in December 2013 and the six stations it acquired from London Broadcasting Company in July 2014.[2][7][8]
In September 2016, Tegna announced plans to spin off Cars.com to create two independent publicly traded companies. Tegna shareholders approved an initial public offering of Cars.com as a publicly-traded spin-off in May 2017.[9][10] Shortly after, Tegna completed the spin-off of Cars.com, which now trades under a new ticker symbol, CARS.[11]
Upon the completion of the spin-off, Dave Lougee, president of Tegna Media, was named president and CEO of Tegna and joined the company’s Board of Directors. Gracia Martore, president and CEO of Tegna, retired and stepped down from the Board.[12]
Prior to the company’s completion of the spin-off of Cars.com, it was reported by DealReporter that Nexstar Media Group may be considering a bid to acquire Tegna.[13] In June 2017, TEGNA announced it had entered into a definitive agreement, together with the other owners of CareerBuilder, to sell CareerBuilder to an investor group led by investments funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board.[14]
Tenga and Cooper Media, parent corporation of the Justice Network, announced on November 7, 2017 a new multicast network, Quest.[15] Tenga would be the charter station group as such would receive a minority stake in the network, which is planned to launch in January 2018.[16] The range of programming on the network would be engineering and science, human achievements, military history and natural history.[17]
Properties[edit]
Tegna owns or operates 46 television stations located in 38 markets (including seven duopolies).[18] 18 of the company's stations are affiliated with NBC (including a semi-satellite of KCEN-TV and a digital subchannel of KBMT), ten are affiliated with CBS, nine are affiliated with ABC, and three are affiliated with Fox. In addition, the company owns two CW affiliates, three MyNetworkTV affiliates and one independent station.
It also provides operational services to KTTU in Tucson through shared services agreements with Tucker Operating Co.

Television Shows[edit]
In 2015, Tegna Media test-ran a limited-run informative talk show hosted by Dallas-based bishop T. D. Jakes on its owned stations in Dallas, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Cleveland. The show, titled T.D. Jakes, was co-produced by Debmar-Mercury, Tegna Media, 44 Blue Productions, Jakes' own production company, TDJ Enterprises and EnLight Productions and lasted from August 17 through September 11.[20]
On December 9, Tegna greenlit the series for an entire run for the 2016–2017 broadcast season. The series debuted on September 12 on most, if not all Tegna-owned stations, as well as several large markets, including Baltimore (WMAR-TV), Detroit (WMYD), Orlando (WFTV/WRDQ), Chicago (WCIU-TV), San Antonio (KSAT-TV), and San Diego (KGTV). Debmar-Mercury, however is not participating in the production run, being replaced by independent company Flow Media Partners.[21]
T.D. Jakes has ended in September 2017 and was replaced with news and entertainment show Daily Blast Live.[22]
Other shows Tegna Media has on first-run syndication across most of its stations are Sister Circle (also shown on cable network TV One)[23], and reality competition Sing Like A Star.[24]
Digital Sites[edit]
Gannett Company spun-off most of its internet media properties to Tegna.[25] When the total internet media division was part of the Gannett Company, it managed the websites for USA Today, as well as Gannett's newspaper and broadcast properties throughout the United States. It owns:

G/O Digital[26]
Premion[27]
CareerBuilder[28][a]




^ Owns 12.5% stake along with majority owners Apollo Global Management and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, as well as minority owners The McClatchy Company and Tribune Media.



Former Digital Sites[edit]

Cars.com - TEGNA completed the spin-off of Cars.com on June 1, 2017.[28]
Cofactor Digital - On December 15, 2016, sold Cofactor to Liquidus, a digital marketing solutions company.[30]

Other Notes:

1 KTVY, KOLD-TV and WALA-TV were acquired with Gannett's purchase of The Detroit News, but were subsequently spun off to Knight-Ridder a day later in order for Gannett to comply with the FCC's then-current limits on group ownership.
2 Owned by Sander Media, LLC, Gannett operated these stations through a shared services agreement (SSA).
3 As part of the Gannett/Belo merger, KMOV, KTVK, and KASW were transferred to Sander Media, LLC; Gannett planned to operate the stations through shared service agreements. However, on December 16, 2013, the Department of Justice ordered that the parties (Gannett, Belo and Sander) had a period of 120 days to divest KMOV to a government-approved independent third-party that would be barred from entering into any agreements with Gannett, in order to fully preserve competition in advertising sales with KSDK. On December 23, shortly after the approval and completion of the Gannett/Belo deal, Meredith Corporation announced that it would purchase KMOV, KTVK and KASW in a $407.4 million deal.[31] The KMOV sale was completed on February 28, 2014.[32] The KTVK/KASW sale was completed on June 19.[33]
4 KTTU is owned by Tucker Operating Co, LLC. Both KTTU and KMSB (owned by Sander Media, LLC) are operated through a SSA by Raycom Media CBS affiliate KOLD-TV.
5 WDAN-TV changed call letters to WICD following its sale, and in 1967 was merged with WCHU (channel 33) in Champaign into the present-day WICD on channel 15.
6 Gannett purchased the construction permit for WINR-TV and signed the station on in 1957. Because of this, WHEC-TV and WDAN-TV are the only television stations built from the ground-up by Gannett.
7 WHEC-TV's frequency was shared with WVET-TV, owned by Veterans Broadcasting, from its 1953 sign-on until 1961 when Gannett purchased full ownership of the frequency.

These cable networks were owned by Belo prior to acquisition by Gannett.
