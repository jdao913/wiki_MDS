History[edit]
The company was founded in 2011 when it made its first acquisition, WBDT, from LIN Media. LIN, the owner of WDTN, could not legally own both WDTN and WBDT. It sold off certain assets including the WBDT's broadcast license to Vaughan Media. The sale was consummated on May 20, 2011, at which point LIN took control of the station via shared services agreement with WDTN.
In 2012, the company acquired television stations owned by PBC Broadcasting which were operated by New Vision Television.[1] The stations have continued under Vaughan ownership while their operator has become Media General until January 17, 2017, when it was acquired by Nexstar.
