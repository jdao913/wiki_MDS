The Family Friendly Programming Forum is a coalition of over 40 advertisers, all of whom belong to the Association of National Advertisers. They seek to increase the amount of "family-friendly" programming on U.S. television.
They define family-friendly programming as:
It is relevant to today's TV viewer, has generational appeal, depicts real life and is appropriate in theme, content and language for a broad family audience. Family friendly programs also embody a responsible resolution. Family friendly programs may include movies, dramas, situation comedies and informational programs.[1]
The FFPF supports various programs and initiatives:

Script Development Fund
Student Scholarship Program

The 2007 reboot of Bionic Woman

Runaway
Commander in Chief
