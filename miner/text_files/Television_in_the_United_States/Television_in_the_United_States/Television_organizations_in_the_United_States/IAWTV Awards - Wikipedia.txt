History[edit]
The IAWTV Awards are hosted annually by the International Academy of Web Television (IAWTV), which was founded in 2008 and is devoted to the advancement of the arts and sciences of web television production.
Inception[edit]
In 2010, before the IAWTV Awards existed, the IAWTV hosted the 2nd annual Streamy Awards.[2] The poor reception of the event,[3] and the surrounding controversy,[4] resulted in a two year hiatus for the Streamy Awards, and the subsequent creation of the IAWTV Awards.[5] The two awards ceremonies are both still running annually, though as completely separate entities.[6]
2011–present[edit]
Since its inception in 2011, the IAWTV has held award ceremonies every year (with the exception of 2016), presenting awards to web series creators and talent in over a dozen categories, covering several genres. Notable IAWTV winners include Felicia Day, Julia Stiles and Milo Ventimiglia, as well as the critically acclaimed web series The Guild, Blue, Anyone But Me, Husbands, and Whatever, Linda.[7]
Between 2012 and 2015, the IAWTV Awards were held in Las Vegas.[8] The 2017 ceremony took place in Los Angeles.[8]
