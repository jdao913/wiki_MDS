The National Captioning Institute (NCI) is a non-profit organization that provides real-time and off-line closed captioning, subtitling & translation, described video, web captioning, and Spanish captioning for television and films. Created in 1979[1] and headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, the organization was the first to caption live TV and home video, and holds the trademark on the display icon featuring a simple geometric rendering of a television set merged with a speech balloon to indicate that a program is NCI-captioned. NCI also has offices in Santa Clarita, California.[2]
