Founded in 1953, the Television Bureau of Advertising (TVB) is a private non-profit association for the commercial television industry in the United States.
In 2008 it launched its ePort system for handling electronic transactions, which by September 2009 had processed 30,000 orders involving around 110 advertising agencies that create advertising and 930 TV stations.[1]
In 2010, it adopted TVB as its official name and refocussed on the message that local stations also offer television commercial time and space on a range of digital channels.[2]
