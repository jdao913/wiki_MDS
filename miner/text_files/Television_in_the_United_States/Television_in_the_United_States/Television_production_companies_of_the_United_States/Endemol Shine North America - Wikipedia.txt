History[edit]

As Shine America[edit]
Shine America began as Reveille Productions, an independently owned television and motion picture studio and production company based in Los Angeles. The studio was founded by Ben Silverman in March 2002. The name Reveille is based on the bugle call used to wake up military personnel; the company logo features a bugler in action.
In 2007, Silverman accepted the job as the new entertainment head at NBC. However, because of the arrangement, he could not profit from any further projects associated with Reveille but continued to work on shows prior to his NBC deal. Silverman left NBC in 2009.
In February 2008, Elisabeth Murdoch's Shine Group bought Reveille for $125 million [1]. Also the same year, ShineReveille International made a deal with Merv Griffin Entertainment to distribute all of MGE programming overseas.
In March 2012, Reveille became known as Shine America.
