Intrepid Pictures is an American independent production company founded in 2004 by Trevor Macy and Marc D. Evans, and is based in Santa Monica, California.
Before it was created, both Evans and Macy worked at both Revolution Studios and Propaganda Films respectively. Shortly after its creation, Rogue, then owned under Universal Studios, announced its deal with Intrepid, in which it's films would be produced, co-financed, and distributed with them for five years. After stumbles, the group broke through with The Strangers and Oculus, as well as the critically acclaimed Hush.
History[edit]
Intrepid Pictures was founded in 2004 by founders and co-CEOs Trevor Macy and Marc D. Evans.[2] Prior to inception, Evans spent 4 years as Revolution Studios' CFO from 2000 to 2004[3] while Macy spent 2 years as the COO of Propaganda Films and independently produced Auto Focus.[4] A year later, Rogue signed a deal with Intrepid to co-produce, co-finance and distribute films with partnership with Universal Studios, Rogue's then-parent company, for five years.[5] The company then debuted with Waist Deep in 2006, which critically flopped but gained $21.35 million worldwide.
In June 2008, the company hired executive Trina Wyatt as the COO and CFO, and at the same time, promoted Anil Kurian to Vice President of Development.[6] In February 2011, Melinda Nishioka was hired as a Coordinator, and as of September 2016 is the new Vice President of Development.[7]
After stumbling in company growth, FilmDistrict then acquired the film rights to what would become Oculus[8] in May 2012. Soon after, the film released on 11 April 2013, to commercial and critical success, earning $44 million over a $5 million budget and received positive reviews. On June 2015, Los Angeles Media Fund co-funded The Bye Bye Man, which originated from a script by Jonathan Penner[9] with STX Entertainment acquiring the film in December.[10]
On March 2016, Trevor Macy attended a discussion with Vice Provost and Jeff Small entitled "Stanford Journeys", which circulated around the corporate business of the film industry.[11] In August, Deadline reported that Diane Admeu-John had a script entitled Diver that was in development with Intrepid.[12] On June, Intrepid also announced their involvement in Ouija: Origin of Evil.[13]
