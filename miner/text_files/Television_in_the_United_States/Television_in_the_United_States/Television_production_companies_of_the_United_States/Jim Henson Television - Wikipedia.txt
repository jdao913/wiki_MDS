Jim Henson Television is the television production arm of The Jim Henson Company. Jim Henson Television has developed many creative shows over the span of four decades.[1]
Some of the more notable television programs produced by the Henson organization include:

Sesame Street- In 1969, the creator of Sesame Street asked Jim Henson to be on the show to improve the creativity of the show. On the show, Jim Henson portrayed characters Guy Smiley and Ernie. However, his biggest work came when he created and portrayed Kermit the Frog. Kermit is an iconic character and still remains popular today. Jim Henson's work on the show is one of the reasons why it is still popular today.
The Muppet Show[2] 1976–1981 – syndicated variety show. Due to Henson's success on Sesame Street, he was able to give his creations more exposure and get them discovered. In 1974, he created The muppet show which lead to other characters being created such as Rizzo the rat, Fozzie the bear, Ms piggy, Rowlf the dog. The show lasted for about nine years and the characters on the show still exist today. [3]This show got a lot of popularity and the familiarity of Kermit the Frog to viewers helped the show. Guest stars even appeared on the show such as John Denver. [4]
