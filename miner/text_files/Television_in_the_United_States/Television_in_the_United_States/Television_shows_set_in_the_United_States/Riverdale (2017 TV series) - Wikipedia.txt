Riverdale is an American television series based on the characters by Archie Comics. The series was adapted for The CW by Archie Comics' chief creative officer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. The series is produced by CBS Television Studios and Warner Bros. Television, in association with Berlanti Productions and Archie Comics. Originally conceived as a feature film adaptation for Warner Bros. Pictures, the idea was re-imagined as a television series for Fox. In 2015, development on the project moved to The CW, where the series was ordered for a pilot. Filming takes place in Vancouver, British Columbia.
The series features an ensemble cast based on the characters of Archie Comics, with KJ Apa in the role of Archie Andrews; Lili Reinhart as Betty Cooper, Camila Mendes as Veronica Lodge, and Cole Sprouse as Jughead Jones, the series' narrator. The cast also features Ashleigh Murray as Josie McCoy and Madelaine Petsch as Cheryl Blossom. Other characters in the series include Fred Andrews, Alice Cooper, FP Jones, and Hermione Lodge, the parents of Archie, Betty, Jughead, and Veronica respectively.
The thirteen-episode first season premiered on January 26, 2017 to positive reviews, before concluding on May 11, 2017. On March 7, 2017, The CW renewed the series for a second season, which premiered on October 11, 2017. In September 2017, a spin-off series, titled The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, was revealed to be in development.

KJ Apa as Archibald "Archie" Andrews: An intense and conflicted teen, Archie is a boyish high school sophomore who got pumped up over the summer working at his father's construction business.

Against the wishes of her mother, Alice, Betty renews her friendship with both Archie and Veronica, while Archie also reconciles with Jughead.

Veronica accuses Hermione of hiring a hitman to kill Fred, but she vehemently denies this and tensions develop between them when Veronica is not sure of her mother is telling the truth. Meanwhile, Cheryl intimidates Penelope—who suffers severe burns due to the fire at their mansion and is hospitalized—into lying that it was an accident. Fred survives his shooting.

The Black Hood reveals to Betty that he knows where Polly is and threatens to kill her unless she publishes a mugshot of Alice, who at the time was a teen on the Southside, which she does. Hiram invites the St. Clair's, friends of the Lodges from New York. On the Southside, Jughead attempts to stop Sweet Pea and the Serpents from blowing up the Riverdale Register office and decides to join the gang to prevent unnecessary violence from happening. Betty's next call from the Black Hood forces her to cut ties with Veronica and Jughead, which she confides in Archie. At the Lodge's open house event, Nick St. Clair drugs Cheryl and takes her back to his hotel room to rape her, but is stopped and beaten by Veronica and the Pussycats. Betty receives a call from the Black Hood telling her to go to an abandoned house, where she'll find who the Black Hood is. Jughead and Toni sit in his trailer, where he tells her his relationship with Betty is over; they kiss. Back at Betty's house, the Black Hood tells her that by telling Archie, she has broken the rules and he will now kill Polly unless she gives him the name of a "sinner" to kill, to which Betty names Nick St. Clair for his rape attempt.

The Black Hood challenges Betty to find the identity of The Sugarman, who has been supplying the jingle jangle to Riverdale. Cheryl wants to press charges against Nick, whom the Black Hood did not attack, but Penelope agrees not to in exchange for money from the St. Clair's. Archie goes to Southside High, where he saves Jughead from a raid organized by McCoy and Sheriff Keller. Tall Boy, F.P.'s right hand man, reaches an agreement with the Ghoulies, the dealers of jingle jangle. Jughead and Archie visit F.P., who tells Jughead to challenge the Ghoulies to a race. During the race, Archie pulls the brake on Jughead's car, and reveals he called Sheriff Keller, who arrests the Ghoulie leader. Veronica convinces Hiram and Hermione to stop investing with the St. Clair's, while Cheryl does the same with Penelope. Later, the Lodges receive a call that the St. Clair's have been run off the road, but will recover in months. Penelope reveals to Cheryl that the Sugarman is Robert Philips; Cheryl later tells Betty, who exposes him in the Blue and Gold. Philips is subsequently arrested and shot by the Black Hood in jail.

Production
Development
Warner Bros. began development on an Archie feature film in 2013, after a pitch from writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and director Jason Moore that would place Archie's gang into a teen comedy feature film in the John Hughes tradition.[56] The duo brought the project to Warner Bros., where a VP recommended a more high-concept direction involving time travel or interdimensional portals, suggesting Louis C. K. to portray an older Archie.[57] Dan Lin and Roy Lee became producers on the project, which eventually stalled as priorities shifted at the studio towards larger tentpole films and was reimagined as a television series.[56] Riverdale was originally in development at Fox, with the network landing the project in 2014 with a script deal plus penalty.[58] However, Fox did not go forward with the project. In 2015, the show's development was moved to The CW,[59] which officially ordered a pilot on January 29, 2016.[60] On March 7, 2017, The CW announced that the series had been renewed for a second season.[61]
Casting
Casting Archie was a difficult process, with Aguirre-Sacasa stating "I think we literally saw every redheaded young guy in L.A. It certainly felt that way."[62] The production team found KJ Apa just three days before they had to present screen tests to the network, which created tension in the last few days leading up to the studio presentation.[62]
In April 2017, it was announced Mark Consuelos had signed on for the second season to play Veronica Lodge's father, Hiram Lodge.[63] The role was in second position to his existing role on Pitch but the cancellation of that series was announced on May 1, 2017.[64] The next month, it was announced Charles Melton was cast to take over the role of Reggie from Ross Butler in season 2 due to his status as a series regular on 13 Reasons Why.[19] It was also announced that Casey Cott was promoted to a series regular.[65] In July 2017, it was announced that True Blood star Brit Morgan had been cast in the recurring role of Penny Peabody, an attorney the Southside Serpents call in case of any run-ins with the law.[66] In August 2017, it was announced Graham Phillips had been cast to play Nick St. Clair, Veronica's ex-boyfriend from New York.[67][68]
Filming




The Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe set in Vancouver, Canada


Filming of the pilot began on March 14, 2016, and ended on April 1 in Vancouver, British Columbia.[69][70] Production on the remaining 12 episodes of season one began on September 7, 2016, in Vancouver.[71] Sets include Pop Tate's Chock'lit Shoppe, a copy of the functioning diner used in the pilot that is so realistic a truck driver parked his 18-wheeler there, believing that it was open.[72] Season two will also be filmed in Vancouver and the nearby Fraser Valley.[citation needed] Principal photography began on June 22, 2017.[citation needed]
Release
Broadcast
Netflix acquired the exclusive international broadcast rights to Riverdale,[73] making the series available as an original series to its platform less than a day after its original U.S. broadcast.[74]
Marketing
In July 2016, members of the cast and the executive producers attended San Diego Comic-Con to promote the upcoming series, where they premiered the first episode "Chapter One: The River's Edge".[75] The first trailer for the series was released in early December 2016, while additional teasers followed later that month and into 2017.[76][77] The CW also sponsored multiple Tastemade videos, where they cooked several foods that are popular in the Archie universe.[78][79][80]
Comic-book adaptation
Along with heavily promoting the TV series in their regular comics since January 2017, Archie Comics are planning to release a comic book adaptation of Riverdale, featuring auxiliary story arcs set within the television series' own continuity. The comic book adaptation is being headed by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa himself, along with various other writers from the show. Alongside a one-shot pilot issue, illustrated by Alitha Martinez, released in March 2017,[81] the first issue of the ongoing Riverdale comic book series was set to release starting April 2017.[82]
In addition to the adaptation, Archie Comics are releasing a series of compilation graphic novels branded under the title Road to Riverdale. This series features early issues from the New Riverdale reboot line, introducing the audience of the TV series to the regular ongoing comic series that inspired it. Archie Comics plans to re-print the volumes of Road to Riverdale in subsequent months as digest magazines. The first volume was released in March 2017.[82]

The first season of Riverdale has received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a fresh rating of 88% based on 54 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.69/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Riverdale offers an amusingly self-aware reimagining of its classic source material that proves eerie, odd, daring, and above all addictive."[83] On Metacritic, the season has a score of 68 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[84] Dave Nemetz of TVLine gave the series a "B+" saying that it turned, "out to be an artfully crafted, instantly engaging teen soap with loads of potential."[85]
Some writers have criticized the series for its handling of minority characters. While reviewing the first season, Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle declared "the show marginalizes and ignores the [people of color] in the cast to the point where they may as well not be there."[86] In an article for Vulture, Angelica Jade Bastien discussed the show's treatment of Josie and the Pussycats (who are each played by African Americans), noting, "They're not characters so much as they are a vehicle for a Message. Josie and her fellow pussycats are positioned to communicate the message that Riverdale is more modern and inclusive than teen dramas of the past, even though it has yet to prove it beyond its casting."[87] Monique Jones of Ebony noted, "Despite the show's multi-racial casting choices, it seems like Riverdale is still a mostly white town." She also expressed fondness for the relationship between Archie Andrews and Valerie Brown, but declared "Archie shouldn't be what makes Valerie interesting to us".[88]
