LAPTV (Latin American Pay Television Service) is a Latin American pay television company founded by many cable providers of the region (MVS Comunicaciones, Grupo Cisneros) and many cinema producers/distributors (such as United International Pictures, distributor of Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios) but since 2013 is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fox Networks Group. It runs several film and television series channels, such as Cinecanal, Fox+ and Film Zone, and previously Moviecity.

History[edit]
LAPTV was formed as a partnership between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, and Fox in Latin America[2] in 1993[1] with Universal Studios joining later.[3] On May 22, 2012, Fox International Channels acquired MGM's stake in LAP TV.[4] In March 2013, Fox purchased Paramount's position in the company, thus becoming the sole owner of LAP TV, and sign a content agreement with LAP TV.[2] Starting in November 3, 2014, all the Premium channels of the pack will be rebranded as "Fox+", dropping the "Movie City" brand definitely, and consolidating the Fox brand in LAPTV with the operations in Fox International Channels.[5] Operations of Cinecanal and Film Zone won't be affected.
