The Comcast Technology Center is a building under construction in Philadelphia.[4][5] The 60-floor building, with a height of 1,121 feet (342 m), will be the ninth-tallest building in the Western Hemisphere (the eight taller ones are all in the United States), and the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere outside Manhattan and Chicago (and therefore the tallest building in Pennsylvania). It is adjacent to the Comcast Center, the headquarters of Comcast Corporation.[6]
Construction began in summer of 2014, topped out on November 27, 2017,[7] and is expected to be completed in 2018.

Design and construction[edit]
The architect is Lord Norman Foster,[8][9][10] with interior design by Gensler.[11] The L.F. Driscoll Company is the construction contractor. Approximately 1.7 million rentable square feet, including 1.33 million rentable square feet of office space, 230,112 square feet of hotel space, and 2,682 rentable square feet of retail space will be created when the tower is completed.
Use[edit]
The view from the top will be more than 40 miles (60 kilometers) in clear weather.
The building will consist primarily of office space and the new Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia, which was formerly nearby.[12] It will also include television studios, a retail mall, a parking garage, and a top-floor restaurant. The entire project contains over 1,500,000 square feet (140,000 m2). The property will be co-owned by Comcast and Liberty Property Trust, and has an estimated cost of $1.5 billion.
Comcast's NBC station WCAU (channel 10), along with Telemundo's WWSI (channel 62) have announced plans to move from Bala Cynwyd to occupy the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth floors of the building with at least three control rooms and three studios, all located on the thirteenth floor, as well as office space.[13]
