Telemundo of Puerto Rico Studios, LLC is a division of NBC-Telemundo that develops original programming in Spanish for station WKAQ-TV in Puerto Rico.
History[edit]
On June 21, 2007, Telemundo of Puerto Rico Studios was created to produce TV programming for viewing in Puerto Rico and internationally. On September 4, 2007, the first project began with a 35-episode season of Decisiones.
Decisiones is a successful TV unitary show. Telemundo has produced more than 500 episodes in 3 countries: Mexico, U.S. (Miami, Florida), and Colombia. Decisiones began on the island, with support of the production team of Decisiones at Telemundo Network. The studios are located at the Telemundo of Puerto Rico facilities in Hato Rey, San Juan, Puerto Rico.
On November 7, 2007 the production hosted a Gala Premier at the Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A Ferré in San Juan. The event was attended by representatives from the government, press, clients, actors and the general public.[citation needed] The production showed clips from the first 9 episodes and the first show's first segment.
Decisiones Puerto Rico, as it was called for local distribution, began on Monday, November the 12, 2007, on Telemundo WKAQ-TV.
