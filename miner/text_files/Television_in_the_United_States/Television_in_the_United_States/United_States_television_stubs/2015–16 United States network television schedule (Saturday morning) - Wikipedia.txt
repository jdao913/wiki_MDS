This was the United States broadcast television schedule on the four commercial television networks airing entertainment programming on Saturday mornings for the season beginning in the fall of 2015 and ending in the spring of 2016. All times are Eastern and Pacific.
This is last season that the all of the cartoons that we aired on Terrestrial television, and the cartoons will continue to air with the advent of Cable television; from next season onwards, Litton Entertainment took control of the four of the five television networks' edutainment programming.
On Fox, Xploration Station and its predecessor, the infomercial block Weekend Marketplace, remains available, and Fox affiliates can carry either lineup.
NBC splits the NBC Kids block on certain weekends due to NBC Sports commitments (including English Premier League).
