This was the United States broadcast television schedule on the four commercial television networks airing entertainment programming on Saturday mornings for the season beginning in the fall of 2016 and ending in the spring of 2017. All times are Eastern and Pacific.
This is the first season Litton Entertainment took control of the four of the five television networks' edutainment programming.
On Fox, Xploration Station and its predecessor, the infomercial block Weekend Marketplace, remains available, and Fox affiliates can carry either lineup.
On NBC, The More You Know debuted on October 8, replacing the NBC Kids block. The block was originally planned to debut on October 1, but was pushed back a week due to NBC Sports coverage of the 2016 Ryder Cup.
