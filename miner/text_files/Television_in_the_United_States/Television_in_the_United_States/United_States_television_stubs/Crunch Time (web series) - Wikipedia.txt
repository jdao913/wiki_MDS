Reception[edit]
Crunch Time was released to limited but mostly positive reviews. Jude Dry of IndieWire gave it an "A" rating, writing, "With snappy dialogue and a premise to delight sci-fi newbies and die-hards alike, the twenty-minute episodes of 'Crunch Time' fly by as quickly as a good dream."[2] In The Daily Dot, Audra Schroeder said the show was like a mix of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Weird Science.[3]
