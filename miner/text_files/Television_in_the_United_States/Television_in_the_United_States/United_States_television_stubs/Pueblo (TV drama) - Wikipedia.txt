Pueblo is an American televised dramatic production that first aired on the ABC on 29 March 1973, as part of its ABC Theater series. Essentially a videotaped stage production, Pueblo was the story of the capture and imprisonment of the crew of the USS Pueblo, a US Navy vessel captured while spying off the coast of North Korea, in 1968.
The production starred Hal Holbrook as Captain Lloyd Bucher, commanding officer of the Pueblo. The structure of the play consists of Captain Bucher answering questions of two tribunals, with the scene switching back and forth between his interrogations by the North Koreans and the inquiry by the US Navy (after his return) into his possible misconduct in the Pueblo Incident. As Bucher describes incidents during the capture of the ship and during the crew's subsequent captivity, the viewer is shown re-enactments of the same.
Holbrook won two Emmy Awards for his performance in Pueblo, one as Best Lead Actor in a Drama and another for Actor of the Year [1]. Pueblo received critical praise, with the New York Times stating, "Pueblo succeeds powerfully as television".[2]
