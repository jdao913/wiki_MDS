Really Raquel was a prime-time variety show adapted from Raquel Welch's 1973 live night club show.[1] The special showcased Welch's talents as a singer, dancer and comedian, pitting her in a variety of skits with the Krofft Puppets, who were the only guest stars[2] (which was highly unusual for a television variety special). Some Krofft sites list the title of the special as Raquel Welch in the World of Sid and Marty Krofft.[3] The show aired on CBS on March 8, 1974.
