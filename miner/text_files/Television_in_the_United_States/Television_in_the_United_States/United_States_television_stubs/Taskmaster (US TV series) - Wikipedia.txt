Taskmaster is a forthcoming American comedy panel game show, originally created by British comedian Alex Horne during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2010, transferred to UK television on Dave in 2015, and later adapted for American television on Comedy Central in 2017. The American TV series stars comedian and actor Reggie Watts in the titular role of the Taskmaster, issuing simple comedic and bizarre tasks to regular contestants, with Horne acting as Watts' assistant and umpire during the challenges.[1][2] The series will be recorded in California,[3] and the contestants for the first series will be Lisa Lampanelli, Freddie Highmore, Ron Funches, Dillon Francis, and Kate Berlant.[4]
