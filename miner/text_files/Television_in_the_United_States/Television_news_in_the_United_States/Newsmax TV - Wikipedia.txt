History[edit]
Network launch[edit]
In May 2014, American news organization Newsmax Media announced that it had signed a distribution deal with DirecTV and would launch a national television news channel to compete directly with CNN, Fox News Channel, and other American news networks. It was launched to provide independent news with a "mainstream conservative tilt" while offering a balanced perspective and being open to all points of view. In addition to politics, Newsmax TV would also provide a full range of informational programming and lifestyle content in the areas of health, finance, and personal well-being.[5] The channel was launched on June 16, 2014. It initially carried live programming from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET, with more programming to be added.
Present[edit]
On June 29, 2015, Newsmax Prime, a Monday through Friday prime time news and talk show launched. It is hosted by former U.S. Representative and talk radio host J. D. Hayworth.[6]
On January 16, 2016, Dennis Michael Lynch: Unfiltered debuted on the channel. Hosted by businessman and filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch, the program featured investigative reporting, interviews, and commentary with a heavy emphasis on user interaction through social media.[7] The program ended after the first segment of the August 10 episode after Lynch announced that he would resign from the network and made comments defending Fox News and criticizing Newsmax TV for its reporting of the Trump campaign and suggesting they were restricting his editorial control; he was escorted out from the network's New York studio in during what would have been the first commercial break.[8] J. D. Hayworth disputed Lynch's claims about Donald Trump, saying that Lynch was not embracing the truth and was engaging in self-censorship. That show was replaced the next Monday with an hour-long video simulcast of radio's The Howie Carr Show from WRKO in Boston.[9]
Broadcast affiliates[edit]
Newsmax TV mainly depends on its carriage on cable services for viewership, along with streaming on their website and open digital media player platforms such as Roku. However, the network carries a small base of over-the-air broadcast affiliates (mainly with the stations of DTV America), numbering twenty-one as of November 2016.
