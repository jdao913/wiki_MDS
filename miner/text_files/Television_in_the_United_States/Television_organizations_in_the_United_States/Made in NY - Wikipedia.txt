Made in NY is an incentive program and marketing campaign of the City of New York Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre & Broadcasting. Under the program, television and film productions which complete at least 75% of their shooting and rehearsal work in New York City are eligible for marketing incentives and tax credits, and can display the Made in NY logo in their closing credits. The logo was created in 2005 by graphic designer Rafael Esquer.[1]
Made In NY also has a training program called the Made in NY Production Assistant Training Program.[2] This trains New York City residents as production assistants[3] and a graduate of the training program is named PA of the Month by the Mayor's Office of Film.
