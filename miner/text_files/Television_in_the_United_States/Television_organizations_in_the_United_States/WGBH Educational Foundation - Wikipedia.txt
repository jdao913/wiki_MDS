History[edit]
In 2003, WGBH and the City of Boston formed a joint venture for Boston Kids & Family TV channel that replace one of the city's cable access channels. Boston Kids was launched on October 31, 2003.[5]
By December 2005, Boston’s WGBH and WNET were already broadcasting a local version of World on a subchannel.[6] and added by April 2006, Washington’s WETA. Then, WGBH and WNET team up with PBS, APT and NETA to roll out a national version of the local channels as PBS World. The network was launched nationally on August 15, 2007.[7]
In July 2012, WGBH acquired Public Radio International (PRI). PRI would continue with its own board while WGBH would be able to distribute more of its programs through PRI.[8]
In November 2015, WGBH purchased GlobalPost with editorial operation and reporting resources being merged with PRI's The World news staff.[9]

Public Media Management[edit]
Public Media Management is a joint venture of WGBH and Sony Electronics for remote TV master control services over the internet.[17]
Public Media Management was tested for a year.[18] The services were available starting April 1, 2015 just before the two Las Vegas shows, PBS’s April 8–10 TechCon and NAB Show April 11–16, to be able to showcase the service during the shows.[17] WGBH's two Boston stations went live with PMM first followed by its Springfield, Massachusetts station WGBY in early May 2015. New Hampshire Public Television launched the system next.[18] In August 2015, Maryland Public Television switched to using their system.[19]
