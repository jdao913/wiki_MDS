51 Minds Entertainment (or Fifty One Minds Entertainment) is a production company specializing in reality TV, known for their "celebreality" programs on VH1.[2][3] It was created in 2004 as a merger between Cris Abrego's 51 Pictures (formerly Brass Ring Entertainment) and Mark Cronin's Mindless Entertainment. In 2005, the company signed a two-year, seven series production deal with VH1.[4] The company has been credited in helping revive VH1 ratings during this time.[5] In 2008, 51% in the company was purchased by Endemol.[1]
In 2010, the company branched out in internet distributed programming, producing The Tester for the PlayStation Network.[6]
