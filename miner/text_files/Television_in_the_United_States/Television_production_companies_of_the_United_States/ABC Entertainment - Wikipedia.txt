ABC Entertainment is a network production company owned by ABC.
History[edit]
In 1999, Walt Disney Television, along with other WDS television units, were transferred out of The Walt Disney Studios to Disney–ABC Television Group[1] to merge with ABC's primetime division to form ABC Entertainment Group.[2]
On January 22, 2009, the change in viewer’s preference and economic disputes resulted in ABC’s decision to combine the television network and production studio into a single unit.[3] During that period, the network was scaling back and deepening in recession resulting in dismissing 5% of its workforce.[4] The company’s audience was shrinking and their advertising revenues were falling. Moreover, the production costs for drama and comedies continued to climb. In June 2009, ABC Entertainment announced a new organization effective immediately[3]
ABC Entertainment is now largely dominant aside from its production. Today, the company is a leader in in-house television and theatrical productions. The production catalogue holds a large variety of programming such as America's Funniest Home Videos.[5] Previously, it produced shows such as My So Called Life and H.E.L.P. since Disney's acquisition of ABC in 1996, virtually all of Disney's adult entertainment programming, such as Desperate Housewives and Grey's Anatomy, have instead been produced by the larger ABC Studios unit. ABC Entertainment is responsible for the networks primetime and late night programming. The programming varies from inclusive scripted dramas and comedies, alternative series, specials, movies, and mini-series.
Within the entertainment industry, "ABC Entertainment" is more often understood to mean the ABC network division responsible for ordering and scheduling. Nevertheless, the network does not produce entertainment programming./>
ABC Entertainment content is available across several mediums. The production company provides on demand-customized content, which appears in mobile video offering.
ABC Entertainment's programming consists of television shows offered directly to customer’s mobile phones. Also, the on-demand features allow the customer to select content from "The Jimmy Kimmel Show" and "The View," allowing the viewer, for instance, to watch only Kimmel's monologue or a particular "The View" celebrity interview. The mobile arrangement offers updates, teasers, and content drawn from ABC's programming.
GoTV is a mobile content firm specialized in making made-for-mobile television programming.[6]
== double-running them on Sundays and Tuesdays to increase “sampling." But both comedies fizzled when they bowed in their new Sunday slots during the course of the week.[7]
