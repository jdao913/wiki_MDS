Calamari Productions is an independent television and digital media production company specializing in child welfare and juvenile justice programming.
The company has the unique distinction of being the only television production company in the United States with state Supreme Court access in numerous states to film inside America's child welfare and juvenile courts, juvenile detention centers, and juvenile prisons. Calamari's access has resulted in numerous award winning documentary films and network television series for outlets including MTV, Dateline NBC, A&E, Court TV, ABC News, MSNBC, PBS and more.[1] The company's unprecedented foray into the U.S. juvenile justice system is unique because these venues are—by law—closed to the media and public.
