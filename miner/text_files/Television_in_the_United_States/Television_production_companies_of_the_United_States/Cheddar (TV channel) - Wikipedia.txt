Cheddar is a live streaming financial news network founded by Jon Steinberg. Cheddar broadcasts live daily from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, the Flatiron Building in New York City, and the White House lawn and briefing room in Washington, D.C.[2] covering new products, technologies, and services.
Cheddar targets millennials by streaming one to two hours of live content from the NYSE trading floor daily, streaming live audio on iHeartRadio, and distributing the videos on video platforms such as Amazon Prime, the Cheddar app, Facebook live, Sling TV, and YouTube.[3]
According to Steinberg, Cheddar received 148 million views in August 2017 across all of its platforms.[4] On Facebook, 60 percent of Cheddar's viewers are under the age of 35.[3] Accordingly, the daily live shows have been described as "quasi-CNBC for millennials".[5]
Reportage focuses on stocks and technology. The channel is ad-free; expected revenue comes from carriage agreements with streaming services.[5] Advertising comprises either program underwriting or semi-weekly brand integration. Brand integration advertising costs $100,000 per year.[6]
Cheddar has two feeds, a paid-for and a free version. The pay feed broadcasts eight hours of programming a day, six live of them live, and is available via Amazon Prime, Sling TV, and the Cheddar app. The free feed broadcasts three hours of new content daily and archived content available through Facebook and over the air via its affiliated stations.[7] On April 2017, the channel had 100,000 viewers.[1]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
Jon Steinberg, former president of Buzzfeed and former CEO of Daily Mail, conceived of the concept after leaving Daily Mail in 2015.[3] He considered naming the channel company "Ticker" until Bustle's founder, Bryan Goldberg, came up with the name Cheddar.[8]
Steinberg founded the company in early 2016 and hired Peter Gorenstein, a senior producer at Yahoo!, as the channel's chief content officer in January 2016. In September 2017, Cheddar hired Anjali Kumar, former Warby Parker executive and Google lawyer, as its first general counsel and chief people officer.[4]
In the company's first financing round in January 2016, it raised nearly $3 million, primarily from Snapchat and Lightspeed's Jeremy Liew, and additional funds from WGI Group, Homebrew, Jerry Speyer, and David Fiszel.[5]
Operating[edit]
Cheddar began streaming in April 2016[1] then on April 11 on Facebook Live[3] with one hour of programming at 9:30 am.[8] Cheddar initially streamed all videos for free, but in May 2016, the company launched a subscription video-on-demand service. Smaller clips continue to be released, but full-length videos are exclusive to subscribers.[9]
Cheddar raised $10 million in funding on September 6, 2016, all of which was an equity deal from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Comcast Ventures, and Ribbit Capital.[9][10] Cheddar used the money to increase programming and set up a new studio in Santa Monica, California, becoming the company's fifth studio.[11][12]
The channel teamed with Bustle to launch its afternoon Extra Sharp show on May 18, 2016.[8] Melissa Rosenthal, a former BuzzFeed executive, was hired in May 2106 as creative development and partnership executive. Five half-hour shows ("Wheels" - automobiles, Points on Point - smart spending, Your Future Home - real estate, Your Cheddar - personal finance, and Cheddar Trading - roundtable discussion on trading) were developed by November 2016, when they were going to shop them to find underwriting.[6] In September 2016, Twitter made a deal with Cheddar to broadcast its daily coverage, with the stated purpose of giving the Twitter community another way to watch and discuss the news live on one platform.[11]
In January 2017, Vanity Fair's Hive business news and Condé Nast Entertainment partnered with Cheddar to create a live weekly series called VF Hive on Cheddar. Graydon Cartern, a Vanity Fair editor, called the series a "representation of how people are consuming more voraciously than ever."[13]
In March 2017, Propagate Content partnered with Cheddar to produce a weekly 45-minute show for international markets. Propagate also became Cheddar's international sales representative.[14]
On August 5, 2017, Cheddar opened its second New York studio at the Flatiron Building, in Manhattan. At the time, the channel had 100,000 viewers. The Flatiron studio was built for its Cheddar Life series.[1]
In April 2017, Cheddar started broadcasting on digital UHF stations in five markets and rents the broadcast spectrum from DTV America. Dunkin’ Donuts, a Cheddar advertiser, was handing out free digital antennas at events in the stations' markets, to publicize the over the air launch.[7]
In May 2017, Cheddar announced $19 million in its third round of financing, which was led by Raine Ventures along with investors: AT&T, Amazon, Altice USA, NYSE, Lorne Michael's Broadway Video, and some existing investors. To date, the company has raised $32.1 million and has a valuation of $85 million.[12] Cheddar also hired Ross Cooperman, former head of engineering at Knowme Systems, as its chief technology officer.[2]
In June 2017, Cheddar partnered with Univision's Fusion Media Group to air on their Fusion TV cable television every weekday afternoon for two hours. The programming will be available for cable users on DISH, DirecTV, AT&T U-Verse, Verizon Fios, and Charter Communications.[15][16][17] Cheddar claims it is on 60 percent of smart TVs throughout the US.[18]
In July 2017, Cheddar partnered with Seeking Alpha to produce an "Idea of the Month" segment.[19] KXTV started airing segments from Cheddar during its morning and afternoon news programming as a test for a planned rollout in the Tenga TV station group. On July 27, the channel was added to the Haystack TV news aggregator app, which is on mobile and OTT platforms.[20]
In September 2017, Cheddar announced its deal with Layer3 TV, an IP-based MVPD,[21] and plans to open a broadcast studio in the UK by 2018.[4]
