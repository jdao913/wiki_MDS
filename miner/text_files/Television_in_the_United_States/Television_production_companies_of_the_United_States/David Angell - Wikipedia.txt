He received a bachelor's degree in English Literature from Providence College.[2] He married Lynn Angell on August 14, 1971. Soon after Angell entered the U.S. Army upon graduation and served at the Pentagon until 1972.[2] He then moved to Boston and worked as a methods analyst at an engineering company and later at an insurance firm in Rhode Island.[3] His brother, the late Most Rev. Kenneth Angell, was a Roman Catholic prelate and former Bishop of Burlington, Vermont.[3]

Angell moved to Los Angeles in 1977.[2] His first script was sold to the producers of the Annie Flynn series. Five years later, he sold his second script to Archie Bunker's Place. In 1983, he joined Cheers as a staff writer.[2] In 1985, Angell joined forces with Peter Casey and David Lee as Cheers supervising producers/writers.[2] The trio received 37 Emmy Award nominations and won 24 Emmy Awards, including the above-mentioned for Frasier, as well as an Outstanding Comedy Series Emmy for Cheers, in 1989, which Angell, Casey, Lee and the series' other producers shared, and Outstanding Writing/Comedy Emmy for Cheers, which Angell received in 1984.[2] After working together as producers on Cheers, Angell, Casey and Lee formed Grub Street Productions.
