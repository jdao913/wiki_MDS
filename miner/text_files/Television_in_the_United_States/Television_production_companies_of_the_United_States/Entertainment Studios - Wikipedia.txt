History
Entertainment Studios was founded by Byron Allen in 2003.[2] Entertainment Studios greenlit its first film and stage projects in December 2011, when it acquired the rights to develop a biographical film and theatrical play on the life of Sammy Davis, Jr. from Davis' daughter with actor/singer, Tracey Davis.[3]
The company ventured into scripted programming in 2012, with the 3rd quarter launch of the sitcoms Mr. Box Office and The First Family.[4] Both are set for 104 episodes[4] over two years under a model of accelerated production similar to Debmar-Mercury's 10-90 Model.[5] The two half hour shows were picked up as a two hour weekend primetime programming block with two episodes of each show back to back by Tribune, Weigel and CBS Television Station groups.[4]
The company launched its eighth cable channel, Justice Central.TV, on December 10, 2012 which is also its first advertising support only channel.[6] The company added a leased production studio in Culver City to its facilities, a headquarter in Century City. In October 2015, the studio acquired Freestyle Releasing for an undisclosed amount "said to be sealed for high-eight figures". Freestyle included a Netflix output deal.[2]
In 2015, the company sued AT&T and Comcast for racial discrimination in being bias against minority run entertainment companies in not carrying its cable channels. AT&T settled in December with the addition of 7 of Entertainment Studios' channels added to AT&T's DirecTV line up. In January 2016, Entertainment Studios added similar suits against Charter and the FCC.[7]
Entertainment Studios made a surprise $20 million bid for The Birth of a Nation at the January 2016 Sundance Film Festival losing to Fox Searchlight.[8] While in July 2016, the company signed a multi-year Blu-ray, DVD, EST and transactional PPV/VOD distribution rights agreement with Anchor Bay Entertainment for all distribution and owned library. With the deal, Entertainment Studios entered the motion picture production business with a film slate of 15 to 20 films per year.[9] The studio acquired its first film in purchasing the North American rights to47 Meters Down from Dimension Films.[10] At the 2017 Toronto Film Festival, Entertainment Studios Motion Pictures pick up at least three films, Chappaquiddick, Replicas, and Hostiles.[11]
TheGrio was purchased by Entertainment Studios in June 2016.[12] In mid-September 2017, the company announced an over the top sports aggregator TV service, Sports.TV, which will be available in the fourth quarter of 2017.[13]
