History
The company was based on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, across Sunset Boulevard from the Chateau Marmont hotel.[3]
Jay Ward Productions was an independent studio from 1948 to 1959. It was part of Dancer Fitzgerald Sample (1959-1979), which originally brokered advertising for, and through its Gamma Productions subsidiary, animated Ward's productions. The Program Exchange acquired broadcast rights in 1979.
Jay Ward Productions today
The successor Jay Ward Production Inc., managed by members of his family, is based in Costa Mesa, California.[4]
By 2007, Jay Ward Productions had formed Bullwinkle Studios LLC, a joint venture with Classic Media (then an Entertainment Rights subsidiary), to manage the Jay Ward characters. Bullwinkle Studios's first production was “George of the Jungle” with Studio B Productions, a unit of DHX Media broadcast on Teletoon, then added to Cartoon Network. Tiffany Ward serves as president of Ward Productions and Bullwinkle Studios.[2][5] Classic Media parent company was acquired by Comcast in 2016.
