History
Lightworkers Media was formed by Mark Burnett and Roma Downey with a partial stake held by Hearst Corporation, which owned a stake in Burnett's One Three Media, reality TV series production company.[1] One of its first productions was The Bible TV series for the History Channel in early 2013.[2] On September 22, 2014, MGM acquired a 55% stake in Lightworkers Media and One Three Media and consolidated the two companies into MGM's new TV production unit, United Artists Media Group, with Burnett as CEO.[1] On December 14, 2015, MGM announced that it had acquired the remaining stake in UAMG in a stock and cash deal, and that Burnett would become the new CEO of MGM Television replacing the outgoing president Roma Khanna.[3] With MGM purchasing out of Hearst and Burnett and Downey's share of United Artist, the channel was still a planned streaming service. However, Hearst and Burnett and Downey retained their stakes in the channel.[4] Film and television studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer announced the formation of Light TV on November 16, 2016, with a launch planned for December on 13 Fox TV Stations.[5]
