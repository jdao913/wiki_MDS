The CW's Sunday night programming[edit]
Media Rights Capital was also responsible for programming The CW's Sunday-night lineup during the 2008–2009 season through a time-leasing arrangement. The first shows to air included the reality show In Harm's Way and the dramas Valentine and Easy Money.[11] Each show had an initial order of 13 episodes.
On November 10, 2008, Media Rights Capital cancelled two of the four shows it produced for The CW. (Both Valentine and Easy Money were put on hiatus with skeleton crews while more scripts were written.) It was expected that MRC would deliver two replacement shows in their place.[12] The CW decided instead to take back control of its Sunday night schedule after the MRC block from the beginning trailed the ratings of CW's Sunday night the year before by a considerable margin.[13][14][15] The network then decided to return the Sunday timeslots to its affiliates as of the 2009-10 season.[16]
