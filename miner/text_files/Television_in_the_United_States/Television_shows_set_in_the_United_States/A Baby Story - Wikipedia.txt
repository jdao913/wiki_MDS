Bringing Home Baby


A Baby Story is an American reality series that began airing on TLC and Discovery Channel in 1998.
Overview[edit]
The show follows a couple through the late days of their pregnancy, sometimes showing the baby shower, final family outing, or dinner party. Then, it always shows the family getting ready to go to the hospital, birth center, or prepare for a homebirth. It films the labor and birth, which is shown on the show. At the end, the family talks about life after the newborn and shows the baby a couple of weeks after birth. The couple then plays with it for a bit before the show closes.
This show was later followed by a spinoff, Bringing Home Baby.
