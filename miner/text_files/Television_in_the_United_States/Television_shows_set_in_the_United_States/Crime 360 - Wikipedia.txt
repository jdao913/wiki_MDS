Crime 360 is an American reality television show based on homicide detective units in various cities across the United States, including Richmond, Virginia; Rochester, New York; Little Rock, Arkansas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Cleveland, Ohio. The detective units in each of these cities use a Leica or a Deltasphere three-dimensional scanner to photograph the crime scene, essentially "freezing" it for study during the investigation; hence, the series title "Crime 360."
It is produced by BASE Productions.[1]
