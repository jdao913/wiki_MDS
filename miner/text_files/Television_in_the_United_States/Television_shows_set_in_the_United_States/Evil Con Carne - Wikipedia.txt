Evil Con Carne is an American animated series/spin-off of Grim & Evil and sister show of The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, created by Maxwell Atoms.[1] The series first appeared on Cartoon Network during the show Grim & Evil, along with The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy. The two series later became separate programs in 2003. While The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy runs for six seasons, Evil Con Carne only runs fourteen episodes and ended on October 22, 2004. It was also part of Cartoon Network's series, Cartoon Cartoons, and is the 16th and final cartoon of the series (albeit on when it was part of Grim & Evil, due to the Cartoon Cartoons brand was temporary discontinued earlier in June 2003; the show itself is considered by some to be a Cartoon Cartoon regardless). An official series finale, titled Company Halt, aired on March 16, 2007.
On April 13, 2012, the series returned to Cartoon Network in reruns on the revived block, Cartoon Planet.[2] On October 7th 2017 the Series came back on Cartoon Network On Demand.

Overview[edit]
Main article: List of Evil Con Carne characters
Hector Con Carne was a "jillionaire playboy" crime lord and evil genius bent on taking over the world and the League of Nations. Eventually, he was caught in an explosion initiated by his nemesis, Cod Commando, a soldier for the Secret Paramilitary Organized Response Kommand (S.P.O.R.K.). The explosion scattered most of his body across the world. He was rescued by a scientist, the curvaceous Major Dr. Ghastly, who placed his living remains into two containment units: one for his brain, and the other for his stomach. These two units were later installed into Boskov, a purple Russian circus bear, giving Con Carne's brain control over (almost) all of the bear's actions and movements.
Hector, Dr. Ghastly and his military leader, General Skarr, then created a secret laboratory on an island with a bunny-shaped mountain known as "Bunny Island" (a parody of Blofeld's lair in the James Bond movies). Gathering an army, Con Carne resumed his quest for world domination and made a new goal: to find his missing body parts.
The "Con Carne" of the title is Spanish/Italian for "with meat", as well as a pun on the expression "evil incarnate" and the dish "Chili con carne".

History[edit]
Evil Con Carne's original show, Grim & Evil, became the result of a viewer's poll in 2000.[3] The poll, titled Big Pick was held on the internet from June 16 to August 25, 2000. The three choices for short films to become animated series were Grim & Evil (shown as Meet the Reaper), Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?, and Longhair and Doubledome. After the event, the Meet the Reaper short film won with 57% of the vote[4] and soon became Grim & Evil. While Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones? became an animated series in 2002, Longhair and Doubledome appeared at another Big Pick event, but lost once again.
Grim & Evil premiered on August 24, 2001, and was cancelled on October 18, 2002.[5] In 2003, Cartoon Network separated the two series and The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy and Evil Con Carne earned their own full-length series. However during 2003 once Evil Con Carne became separate from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy the previous episodes of Evil Con Carne that first aired on Grim & Evil where shown only (meaning that this short-lived series was essentially re-runs). In 2004, the series returned with newly produced episodes only to be cancelled once again once later that year.
After Evil Con Carne was cancelled its characters appeared in The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy. The first cameo was in the episode "Chicken Ball Z" which ended with Mandy purchasing Hector's Bunny Island. General Skarr moved to Billy's neighborhood in the episode "Skarred for Life" after Bunny Island was bought out by an "entertainment corporation that didn't want competition in world domination". Since then General Skarr has been a recurring character in the Grim Adventures. In the episode "Company Halt", Con Carne and Ghastly appear in Endsville, in order to recruit Skarr and revive Evil Con Carne (the organization, not the show) in another attempt to take over the world; naturally, like most of their other schemes and misadventures, it ends in failure. According to Tom Warburton, characters from Evil Con Carne (as well as Sheep in the Big City were originally set to appear in the television special The Grim Adventures of the KND.[6] Hector, General Skarr, and Dr. Ghastly did briefly appear in the end credits in a crossover with Camp Lazlo titled "Evil Camp Carne".
Two episodes are included as bonus features in the Season 1 DVD set for The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy,.[7]

As General Skarr is once again annoyed by Billy, Hector Con Carne and Major Dr. Ghastly arrive in his house with the intention of luring him back to the recently relaunched Evil Con Carne world domination organization. Although initially refusing to rejoin, Skarr later accepts with the condition that Billy and the other neighbors be destroyed. After weeks of living together and preparations, Evil Con Carne's ultimate weapon is revealed to be an army of tanks that shoot giant rubber bands. In the end, Skarr's all-out attack over the neighborhood is foiled when Billy tricks Hector into shooting Skarr's garden and they get into a fight.
Note: This episode aired as a segment of The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy.
