October Road


Going To California is an American dramedy television series created for Showtime and airing from 2001 to 2002 on that channel. It starred primarily Sam Trammell and Brad William Henke as Kevin "Space" Lauglin and Henry "Hank" Ungalow respectively, two friends on a road trip across the continental United States. The show focused primarily on what happened to Hank and Space during their stops and detours along the way to California. John Asher played the recurring character "Insect Bob" and also served as a director on the series. The tag line for this show was: "No map. No plan. No rules. No turning back."
The show featured guest stars in each episode, including Lindsay Sloane, Jenny McCarthy (John Asher's then wife), David Faustino, Jaime Pressly, Vince Vaughn, Stacey Dash, Rosanna Arquette and Jerry O'Connell.
Going To California was cancelled in 2002 after 20 episodes despite a positive critical response, and despite a cult following it has never been issued on DVD.[1] In 2007 creator Scott Rosenberg returned with the show October Road, which was loosely based on Going To California; Evan Jones reprised his role as "Ikey" and a new actor played "Eddie Latekka", both of which characters had appeared in the original show, while Brad William Henke played a new character.
