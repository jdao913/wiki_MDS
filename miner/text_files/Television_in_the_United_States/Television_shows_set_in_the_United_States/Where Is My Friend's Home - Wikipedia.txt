Background[edit]
The show follows South Korean and foreign cast members of the South Korean television Non-Summit as they experience cultures of various countries through homestay,[7] meeting the locals, and experiencing a better understanding of multiculturalism.[8][9]
The show, a spin-off of Non-Summit, is less formal, with the cast from the original talkshow panel, now relaxing casually, as "friends", to visit one another's homes. The humor continues; the teaser video for the first episode, a trip to China, was entitled "Steal Things in Zhang Yuan’s House".[1][10] The show's posters, entitled "Global friend’s house attack project", showed some of the cast's casual activities, like eating ice cream and jogging.[11]
And although somewhat like a travel show, producers said Where is My Friend's Home trips would "not be typical."[4][7] The show also candidly addresses common misperceptions and prejudices about the countries visited.[12][13]
Season 1[edit]
Cast[edit]
Through the fourth trip, the cast was made up entirely of Non-Summit cast members, current and past.[14] After that, some new cast members were added, including South Korean television personalities and K-pop idols; who, in some cases, played host in their respective countries, augmenting the list of foreign cast members and countries visited.[14] The first instance was the fifth trip to Canada which visited Henry Lau's home in Toronto, as well as Non-Summit cast member Guillaume Patry's home in Quebec.[15]
