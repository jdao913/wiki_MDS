Premise[edit]
Z Nation begins three years into a virus-caused zombie apocalypse, which has already killed most humans. In the days just before society fell apart, Murphy was one of three inmates at Portsmouth Naval Prison in Kittery, Maine, who were unwilling participants in a government-approved experiment. Each inmate was given a different test vaccine. Murphy was the only one to survive the vaccine injection. He is the only known survivor of a zombie bite who did not himself turn into a zombie, and his blood contains antibodies that are mankind's last and best hope for a vaccine.
A group must transport Murphy from New York to the world's last known functioning Centers for Disease Control research lab in California. However, Murphy harbors a dark secret that threatens them all.[5]

Recurring cast[edit]

Lisa Coronado as Dr. Marilyn Merch (seasons 1–3)


Dr. Marilyn Merch is a genetic recombiner and Harvard graduate, skilled in gene splicing. She disappeared two years before the zombie outbreak and resurfaced at the Portsmouth Naval Prison infection lab, where she injected three prisoners, including Murphy, with experimental vaccines. The vaccines worked, but killed the other two prisoners. Due to a security breach by a horde of zombies, Merch was forced to leave the lab via helicopter. She is later known to be at a lab in Fort Collins, Colorado, where Dr. Kurian claims she "didn't make it". In the season 2 finale, she resurfaces aboard the CDC submarine lab. She escapes the sinking submarine, but is bitten by Murphy and is now controlled by him. She uses small doses of the original cure to regain control of herself. After Murphy finds out, he bites her a second time. To break control for good, Merch walks into a cage of zombies, injects herself with the cure and is then eaten alive by the zombies.


Mark Carr as Sketchy McClain (season 1–present)


Sketchy McClane, an old acquaintance of Doc, is a weapons dealer and travels with his friend Skeezy.


Doug Dawson as Skeezy (season 1–present)

Sara Coates as Serena (seasons 1–3)


Serena, a tough guard at the Sisters of Mercy camp, is first seen in the 11th episode of season 1, "Sisters of Mercy". She has a brief fling with Murphy outside the camp, resulting in her pregnancy. After the destruction of the Sisters of Mercy, she eventually catches up to Murphy and the Westward-bound survivor group. She dies shortly after giving birth, protecting her baby from a horde of zombies. She is given mercy by Warren at the request of Murphy.


Donald Corren as Dr. Walter Kurian (seasons 1–2)


Dr. Walter Kurian, the main antagonist of season 1, is first encountered in episode 13, "Doctor of the Dead". Kurian is revealed to be responsible for the virus known as H1Z1, which caused the zombie apocalypse. Working at a lab in Fort Collins, Colorado and using samples he gathered from Krokodil addicts in New York, Ebola camps in Africa, abandoned bioweapons in Kazakhstan, and brain matter from a man in Haiti, he created the "Red Death" virus, meant for use in biological warfare. The virus escaped the lab by infecting a lab technician named Brandon Doyle. From there it spread, and in the resulting chaos, Kurian fled and went underground. The right side of his face appears scarred from the nuclear blast in the season 2 premiere.


Gina Gershon as La Reina (season 2)


La Reina, also referred to as "the Queen of the Dead", is first seen in the 12th episode of season 2, "Party With the Zeros". She has inherited the leadership position of the Zeros drug cartel from her deceased husband Gonzalo. Throughout season 2, she and her gang attempt to hunt down "The Murphy" so she can control a cure made by the captured Dr. Kurian, who is now her servant. She dreams of creating a new world order, with her in charge. After Warren appears to save her from an assassination attempt, she offers him a place in her regime. In the season 2 finale, La Reina is killed by Alvarez during a fight between Warren and La Reina.

He hurts his leg badly, contracting gangrene, and when told that the leg requires amputation, he murders his former medic by throwing him into an airshaft. When the Westward-bound survivor group reaches his stronghold in need of a helicopter, McCandles allows Doc in, believing him to be a real doctor, and throws him into the same airshaft when Doc gives him the same prognosis.

Production[edit]
Z Nation is produced by Go2 Digital Media for The Asylum.[6] On June 29, 2014, it was announced that the filming of 13 episodes for the first season of the series was underway.[7][8] On October 12, 2014, Syfy announced that it had ordered a second season of Z Nation.[9][10] Schaefer and Engler have described Z Nation as an attempt to "put the fun back into zombies", criticizing shows like The Walking Dead for being too serious.[11] Z Nation's first season had a budget of less than $700,000 per episode.[12]
Reception[edit]
 The first season of Z Nation received mixed reviews from professional television critics. Its aggregate score on Metacritic is 48/100 based on reviews from 11 critics.[13][14] Rotten Tomatoes gave the show a rating of 53%, based on reviews from 17 critics, with the site's consensus stating "although it's hampered by an overcrowded narrative, Z Nation manages to muster up some fun scares without taking itself too seriously."[15]
Chris Carabott of IGN noted that the show "continues to set itself apart in campy and inventive ways."[16] Brian Moylan of The Guardian called Z Nation scary "in the same vague way as that talking green blob is in the Mucinex commercials" and concluded that viewers would hate all the characters, but that "Citizen Z (DJ Qualls) is especially horrible."[17] Merrill Barr of Forbes magazine said the show had a high entertainment value.[18]
 In its first season, Z Nation averaged 1.42 million viewers per episode, including a .48 rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic.[19]
