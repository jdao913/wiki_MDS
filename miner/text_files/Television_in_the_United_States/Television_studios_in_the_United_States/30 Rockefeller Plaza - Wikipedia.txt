30 Rockefeller Plaza is an American Art Deco skyscraper that forms the centerpiece of Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Formerly called the RCA Building from 1933 to 1988, and later the GE Building from 1988 to 2015, it was renamed the Comcast Building on July 1, 2015, following the transfer of ownership to new corporate owner Comcast. Its name is often shortened to 30 Rock. The building is most famous for housing the NBC television network headquarters. At 850 feet (260 m) high, the 70-story building is the 14th tallest in New York City and the 39th tallest in the United States. It stands 400 feet (122 m) shorter than the Empire State Building.
The building underwent a $170 million floor-by-floor interior renovation in 2014. The renovation included new Comcast signage atop the building; new ground-level signage that reads Comcast Building; and, for the first time, the display of the iconic NBC Peacock logo on the building's exterior.

History[edit]




Rockefeller Center, featuring the RCA Building (December 1933)






Lunch atop a Skyscraper, a famous photograph taken during construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza.


The building was completed in April 1933 as part of the construction of the Rockefeller Center.[4] The noted Art Deco architect Raymond Hood led a team of Rockefeller architects.[5] It was named the RCA Building for its main tenant, the Radio Corporation of America, formed in 1919 by General Electric. The famous photograph Lunch atop a Skyscraper was taken during the construction of the 69th floor. The National Broadcasting Company, had both the Red Network and the Blue Network housed in the new building, which was also nicknamed "Radio City". NBC was the first national radio network in the country and was founded by RCA in 1926.
The office of the Rockefeller family occupied Room 5600 on the 56th floor until 2014.[6] This space is now occupied by Rockefeller Family and Associates, whose offices span the 54th to 56th floors. John D. Rockefeller had a private vault in the basement of the building, accessible via a private elevator from his office.[7]
In 1985, the complex acquired official landmark status. The RCA Building was renamed as the GE Building in 1988, two years after General Electric re-acquired the RCA Corporation.[8] In 1996, NBC bought the space it had leased in the center for over sixty years.[9]
The building's address became the title of the NBC sitcom 30 Rock (2006–2013), which follows the cast and crew of a fictional television show filmed inside the building. Aside from two live episodes, which were produced at NBC's facilities inside the building, the series used the building mostly for exterior and occasional lobby shots, while interior scenes were filmed at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, Queens.
From the end of 1960 through October 1993, the building's mezzanine level housed the New York City weather forecast office of the National Weather Service; it was relocated to eastern Long Island, on the grounds of Brookhaven National Laboratory at Upton, New York.[10] KWO35, the NOAA Weather Radio station serving the majority of the Tri-State area, originally transmitted from atop the building and remained there until 2014. Due to interference with a U.S. Coast Guard radio channel, the transmitter was eventually relocated atop the MetLife Building.[11][12] A weather radar station was also located atop the building[13] (it was previously used as Doppler 4000 during WNBC-TV's local newscasts).
In June 2014, Comcast was granted permission from the Landmarks Preservation Commission to make modifications to the building to reflect its ownership of NBCUniversal. The GE Building would be officially known as the Comcast Building.[14][15] Comcast planned to replace the neon GE lettering from the top of the building with a 10-foot (3.0 m) tall, LED-lit Comcast wordmark and NBC logo, and add a 17-foot (5.2 m) NBC logo on the building western's facade. Additionally, a new marquee was added to the Avenue of the Americas entrance, advertising it as the home of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[14][16][17] On July 1, 2015, the name change and new signage were made official.[18]
Building description[edit]




Facade in Feb 2007


30 Rockefeller Plaza is 872-foot-tall (266 m) and anchors the entire Rockefeller Center complex. 30 Rockefeller Plaza was built as a single structure occupying the entire block between Sixth Avenue and Rockefeller Plaza,[19] and its design was influenced by John Todd's desire for the building to use its air rights to their maximum potential.[20][21] It has three main segments: the 70-story tall tower rising from the eastern part of the base; a windowless segment in the middle of the base; and a shorter 20-story tower on the western part of the base.[20]
As an icon of the complex, 30 Rockefeller Plaza's architecture influenced the design of the rest of the complex,[22] with its limestone facade and Gothic-inspired four-leafed spandrels.[23][24] Lee Lawrie's carved renderings of wisdom, sound, and light—respectively above the east, south, and north entrances—are complemented by two limestone bas-reliefs: one of production on the north elevation, and one of radio on the south elevation.[25][26] The wisdom frieze above the entrance is accompanied by an inscription that reads: "Wisdom and Knowledge shall be the stability of thy times", from Isaiah 33:6 (KJV).[27]
The eastern tower contains the famous Rainbow Room restaurant on the 65th floor,[28]:325 while the Rockefeller family office occupied the tower's 54th through 56th floors until 2014.[6] The tower also hosts the headquarters of NBC,[29] housing the NBC Studios; the TV network's NBC News, MSNBC, and network flagship station WNBC-TV;[6] and until 1988, the radio station WNBC.[30] Although NBC has continuously occupied the building since 1933,[31] it did not own the space it occupied until 1996, when it gained ownership within a condominium arrangement.[9] The base of the tower is set back from the side streets in order to comply with the 1916 zoning law without having as many setbacks on higher floors. As a result, the walls of 30 Rockefeller Plaza rise straight up in a "slab"-like format—a rarely constructed architectural form before the complex was erected—with only gentle setbacks above the 30th floor.[32][33] All of the tower's offices were specified so that no office was more than 27.5 feet (8.4 m) from a window, the maximum distance where sunlight can permeate the offices.[34] From 1937 on, the top of the tower also contained 24-foot-tall (7.3 m) neon letters spelling "RCA",[35] though these were later replaced by "GE" letters, and in 2014, replaced again with Comcast and NBC logos.[6]
Below the building is a shopping concourse, connected to the lobby via escalators. The open lobby's rich materials and reduced black and beige ornamental scheme is enhanced by dramatic lighting. Granite covers the building base to a height of 4 ft (1.2 m) and the shaft has a refined facade of Indiana Limestone with aluminum spandrel panels.
Part of NBC's space also extends into the central part of the tower. Since the middle of a block was seen as typically not a well-desired location for Manhattan office space, this segment was planned without windows, which was suitable for NBC's studios.[20] This section of the building contains a 0.75-acre (0.30 ha) "Garden of the Nations" atop its roof (see § Rooftop gardens).[22][36][37] In 1936, the central section's roof temporarily housed a prototype of an apartment, which was used to advertise the Rockefeller Apartments between 54th and 55th Streets.[38][39] Afterward, the roof was proposed as the site of a solar heat-powered "management and conference center".[38][40]
1250 Avenue of the Americas, formerly known as the RCA Building West and now known by its address, serves as the western annex of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The building is accessed mainly from Sixth Avenue.[41] It is made of the same material as the original RCA Building, with a similar design. The facade of the annex rises straight from the sidewalk, set back from the corners because there were private properties at these corners at the time of the building's construction in 1935.[42] The recessed entrance portal is filled with a 79-by-14-foot (24.1 by 4.3 m) mosaic mural of "Intelligence Awakening Mankind" by Barry Faulkner. The portal itself is located underneath four 11.5-by-4-foot (3.5 by 1.2 m) limestone panels by Gaston Lachaise, each of which signifies an aspect of civilization as it related to the original Radio City complex.[43]
Rainbow Room[edit]
Main article: Rainbow Room
The 65th floor of the building is an event room and restaurant named the Rainbow Room, previously run by the Cipriani family.[44] Opened in 1934, it was the first restaurant to be located in a high-rise building and remained the highest elevated restaurant in the United States for decades. Suffering from a decline in business following the financial crisis of 2007–08, the restaurant closed in 2009. In 2012, it was declared a New York City landmark by the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission.[45]
On September 17, 2013, it was announced that the Rainbow Room would reopen in fall 2014 after undergoing a full restoration along with a new executive chef and management team.[46][47] After a years-long restoration process by Gabellini Sheppard Associates, it reopened to the public on October 5, 2014,[48] with new owner-operator Tishman Speyer and chef Jonathan Wright at the helm.[49] The renovation includes the landmarked dance floor and a new cocktail lounge called SixtyFive.[48]
Observation deck[edit]
The observation deck atop the skyscraper, dubbed "Top of the Rock", reopened to the public on November 1, 2005, after undergoing a $75 million renovation. It had been closed since 1986 to accommodate the renovation of the Rainbow Room. The deck, which is built to resemble the deck of an ocean liner, offers sightseers a bird's eye view of the city, competing with the 86th floor observatory of the Empire State Building 200 feet (61 m) higher. It is often considered the best panoramic city view,[50] if only because it offers a view of the aforementioned Empire State Building, which cannot be seen from its own observation deck.[51] The timed entry system and larger observation deck also results in shorter waiting times compared to the Empire State.
The "Top of the Rock" had also been co-opted for NBC's Sunday Night Football during the 2006–07 season, with the top player/MVP in that night's game according to John Madden and Al Michaels receiving the honor of being that night's "Rock Star" in the form of a glass trophy display on the observation deck; this was a replacement for the Horse Trailer Award formerly awarded on ABC's Monday Night Football. The Horse Trailer honor was restored for the 2007–08 season.

The Comcast Building is well known for housing the headquarters of NBC, the New York facilities of NBC Studios, and NBCUniversal Cable. In 1996, NBC bought the 1,600,000 square feet (150,000 m2) of space it had leased since 1933. The purchase allowed the company to introduce new technologies and renovate the space; it also gave them options to renew the lease on the Today Show studios, broadcast from a nearby building, 10 Rockefeller Plaza.[52] NBC occupies floors 2-19, 21, 27, 46-47, and 51.
The building's studios include Studio 8H, the home of Saturday Night Live. Studio 8H was once the largest radio studio in the world, originally home to the NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini.[53] It was converted into a television studio in 1950. The Tonight Show was also taped at the building in Studio 6B from the early Jack Paar years until 1972, when the show moved to Burbank, California. In 2014, The Tonight Show returned to Studio 6B with its latest incarnation, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[54] Tonight's companion program, Late Night, now branded Late Night with Seth Meyers, has been produced from the building since it started in 1982; the relocation of Tonight back to New York in 2014 brought the two shows under one roof for the first time. During its run, Rosie O'Donnell broadcast her syndicated talk show from the building.
