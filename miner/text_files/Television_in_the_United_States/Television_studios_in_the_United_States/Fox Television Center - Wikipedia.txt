Fox Television Center is a television studio facility located at 1999 South Bundy Drive in West Los Angeles in Los Angeles, California, in the United States.
The studios and offices of two Los Angeles television stations owned by Fox Television Stations Group, KTTV (Channel 11) and KCOP (Channel 13), are located here. The facility also houses Fox Sports' studio shows for the National Football League and other sports.
KTTV moved here from its former longtime home at Metromedia Square in Hollywood in 1996, which had been sold to the Los Angeles Unified School District in 2000 and demolished in 2003 to make way for Helen Bernstein High School.
KCOP's studios were also located in Hollywood for a long time on La Brea Avenue until it moved to share space with its sister station in 2003.
Across the street from this facility is the home of Asian-language television station KSCI.
