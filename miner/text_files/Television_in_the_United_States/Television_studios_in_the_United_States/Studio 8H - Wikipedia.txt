It is most notable for housing the live broadcast of Saturday Night Live, which has been broadcast from the studio since the show's inception.
Construction[edit]
Studio 8H was originally constructed for Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1937. At the time of construction, Studio 8H was the world's largest radio studio, 132 X 78 feet with the height of three stories, which could house a full orchestra.[1] It was converted for television use in 1950, primarily for the live broadcast of Kraft Television Theatre.[2]
History[edit]
Studio 8H is now most prominent for housing the NBC sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, which is broadcast live from Studio 8H.[3] Two episodes of NBC sitcom 30 Rock, "Live Show" and "Live from Studio 6H" were also broadcast live from the studio, a departure from the show's usual film format.[4][5]

Likewise, Later with Bob Costas, Love, Sidney, the 50th anniversary of television episode of Today in 1990, "House Party with Steve Doocy" and the 5th anniversary special of Late Night with David Letterman were broadcast from Studio 8H.

In May 2002, NBC celebrated its 75th anniversary and used 8H to shoot the live broadcast of the event.
