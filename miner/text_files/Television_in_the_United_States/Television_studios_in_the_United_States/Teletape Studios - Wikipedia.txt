Reeves Teletape Studios was a group of television studios located in Manhattan in New York City. Owned by Reeves Communications Corporation, it was formed in 1974 by the merger of Reeves Sound Services (a sound and video post-production company and successor to the former Reeves Soundcraft - founded by Hazard E. Reeves), and Tele-tape Productions (a video remote truck and studio facility firm based in NY). Unitel Video bought the studio and its assets in 1987, and operated them until at least 1993.
Studios[edit]

Second Stage (CBS Studio 72, 81st Street and Broadway) This studio was the first home to Sesame Street and later The Electric Company, 3-2-1 Contact, Search for Tomorrow, Love, Sidney and Kate & Allie. Demolished except for its facade in 1986.
Third Stage (CBS Studio 58, Ninth Avenue and 55th Street) Originally home to The Dick Cavett Show for the show's PBS run, Sesame Street moved here in 1982 and remained until the studio's bankruptcy.[1]
Ed Sullivan Theater (CBS Studio 50, 53rd Street and Broadway) A CBS soundstage that had been home to The Ed Sullivan Show, Teletape used the building during the 1980s for productions such as episodes of Kate & Allie. CBS regained control of the facility in 1993, when David Letterman began taping his Late Show there.
