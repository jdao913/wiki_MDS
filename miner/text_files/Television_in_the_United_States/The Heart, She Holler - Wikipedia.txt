Characters[edit]
The Heartshe family[edit]

Hurlan Heartshe (Patton Oswalt) – Secret son of Hoss Heartshe, hidden away "since the minute he was born" in a cave, where he lived for forty years without any human contact, nor ever seeing the light of day, until he is brought out to run the town of Heartshe Holler. Of his character, Oswalt said "I thought of Kaspar Hauser. That was my model – lethally nonjudgmental of the world to himself, that he trusts everything's going to be awesome."[4]
Hurshe Heartshe (Kristen Schaal – season 1; Amy Sedaris – season 2-3) – Psychotic, vindictive, and oversexed sister to Hurlan and Hambrosia. Endlessly plotting to take over the town from Hurlan. It is established in Season 2 that Hurshe was actually married, but her husband is in jail. Moreover, Hurshe had two children with him, a boy and a girl, but she didn't bother naming them. Instead, she keeps her two children in a secret compartment underneath her bed, echoing the childhood of their uncle Hurlan.
Hambrosia Heartshe (Heather Lawless) – Hurlan's other sister, who possesses telekinetic and mind-reading powers. She is also trying to take over the town and/or kill her sister. Very religious and married to the town sheriff, she was "born without lady parts", although she carries on an affair with severed ectoplasmic hands.
Sheriff (Joseph Sikora - season 1-2; Scott Adsit - season 3) – The corrupt and generally incompetent sheriff of Heartshe Holler, he is married to Hambrosia and in love with her sister Hurshe after seeing her hang herself.
"Boss" Hoss Heartshe (Jonathan Hadary) – The leader, founder, and owner of the Town of Heartshe Holler who died at the beginning of the series after working tirelessly on his extensive video will in which he leaves Hurlan his fortune and full control of the Holler. He appears in every episode through the video will which he uses to teach and guide Hurlan. He is resurrected in the last episode of the first season when his corpse and living will are posthumously sentenced to "re-death" in the electric chair.
"Meemaw" Virginia Dare (Judith Anna Roberts) The matriarch of Heartshe Holler, and the bearer of the curse of Heartshe, being unable to die – though Boss Hoss reveals at the end of Season 1 that the real secret curse is that she can die, through unspecified means, and if she does it will result in the destruction of Heartshe Holler. It is explained in Season 2 that most if not all of the bizarre incidents which occur in the Holler are due to Meemaw's psychic control, which she uses to play twisted games with the inhabitants of the town for her own amusement. For example, Hurshe's affair with her own sister's husband was largely encouraged by Meemaw's psychic influence. Hambrosia may have inherited her psychic powers from Meemaw, but it is unclear which of them is stronger. In the Season 2 finale Meemaw's real name is first given as "Virginia Dare", and in Season 3 it is confirmed that she is the actual Virginia Dare, "the first white person born on this continent". Her birth so offended the gods of the indigenous peoples that she was cursed.

Townsfolk[edit]

"Doc" (Kevin Breznahan) – The town's doctor, formerly an auto mechanic. He's also quite a skilled plumber.
The Reverend (Leo Fitzpatrick) – The immoral and cowardly religious leader of the town. Formerly a criminal named "Psycho Mike"
Cutter (Michael Laurence) – A sleazy handyman who was Boss Hoss's right-hand man and enforcer. He did the dirty work of reining in anyone who challenged Hoss's control of the town. In his video will, Hoss says that over the years he came to think of Cutter as the son he never had - only to then bluntly denounce that Cutter is not of course his son, and therefore he doesn't need to give him any inheritance, leaving Cutter emotionally devastated. Cutter also occasionally has flashbacks about all of the victims he killed.
Jacket (David Cross) – an overweight redneck who always wears shirts bearing the Confederate flag. He runs the bar section of the town's combined bar/convenience store, along with his wife Direne. Jacket and Direne first appear in Season 2. By Season 3, he stars in his own local access TV talk show, Wake Up White People.
Direne (Jennifer Regan) Jacket's wife, who runs the front convenience store section of the town's combined bar/convenience store.

The Preacher delivers fire and brimstone sermons that consumption of meat is evil, because it leads to homosexual behavior. The new ban is hypocritical, as the Preacher himself continues to eat meat in private. Hurlan is attracted by the smell but the Preacher deflects attention from himself by insisting that Hurlan's soul is in danger if he continues to want meat. The Preacher takes him on a weekend prayer retreat in the woods to Camp Praythegayaway, but he soon becomes lost. Awakening, Hurlan is convinced that his desire to eat meat actually did result in some sort of homosexual-orgy-apocalypse, which destroyed human civilization. Hurlan therefore settles into the camp and attempts to rebuild civilization from scratch. Meanwhile, with Hurlan missing, Boss Hoss's video will instructs that Hambrosia will lead the town in his absence. Finally in charge, she decides to "cut loose" by listening to vinyl records and taking a bite of tobacco chaw – which nearly kills her. Hambrosia subsequently bans all forms of tobacco from town, and goes door to door with a shotgun in hand to make sure the ban is in effect. However, Hurshe one-ups her sister by making her own smoke-easy in the local bar. Hurshe makes up her own phoney religion of "Chawstafarianism" and claims the legal loophole that chaw is her religion's "sacred herb" and thus cannot be regulated. The two sisters find themselves at loggerheads.

Hurshe's estranged husband, formerly one of the most feared and terrible men in the Holler, is released from prison and returns to town. This further complicates the affair between Hurshe and the Sheriff. The Preacher is upset as well, because before he joined the Church he used to be a drug mule for Hurshe's husband. Meanwhile, Hambrosia is once again upset that she was "born without lady parts", until she is told that the Doctor can surgically give her some. Hurshe's husband decides to get revenge by having sex with Hambrosia – by making the Preacher have sex with her. Note: Hurlan does not appear in this episode.

Feeling lonely, Hurlan takes to using an old typewriter, and actually writes a book-length manuscript. He soon becomes a Truman Capote-esque novelist, respected by the town as their first and only literary great. Meanwhile, it is revealed that by manipulating cloth dolls of them on a chessboard, Meemaw psychically influences the townsfolk for her own twisted games. Many of the bizarre occurrences, rivalries, and love triangles in the town were really created by Meemaw for her own petty amusement, such as Hurshe having an affair with the husband of her own sister. When Hambrosia learns of this she becomes outraged that Meemaw is forcing the town's inhabitants to commit negative, sinful acts which they aren't actually responsible for. She attempts to round up everyone into the church to pray away Meemaw's influence, but to no avail, as Meemaw psychically hijacks the meeting. However, Boss Hoss' video will reveals to Hurlan that there is one cloth doll Meemaw doesn't know about, which he hid under his hat: a doll of Meemaw herself. Hurlan uses the doll to control Meemaw and force her to relinquish her gameboard to him, to set the townsfolk free.

Hurlan wishes to leave town, even though Boss Hoss says that the curse prevents anyone from leaving. To prevent him from trying, the townspeople arrange a fake vacation for Hurlan, sending him on a fake airplane ride (in a port-a-potty) and then pretending that the Holler is really a different town called "Truthton" (so-called because they insist it truly is a different town). Everyone uses fake names and bad disguises to trick Hurlan into thinking he's on vacation, i.e. Direne the convenience store clerk wears a wig and a nametag that says her name is "Dirette". Hanging around with Hurlan on his vacation, Dirette becomes infatuated with how nice and devoted he is. "Dirette" decides to leave her husband and Hurlan offers for her to "return" with him to the Holler. However when they exit the port-a-potty "airplane", no one recalls making the "Truthton" trick, and the original Direne is still there (indicating that either Truthton or this Holler is another alternate reality). However, Dirette promptly falls in love with Direne's husband (identical to her husband) and leaves Hurlan, while Direne tries to get revenge on them by seducing Hurlan (who declines because he is still infatuated with her identical double, Dirette). Despondent, Hurlan puts all of his father's video will tapes in a pile and burns them, hoping this will destroy his hold on him, but it actually sets his spirit free. Meanwhile, the town Doctor discovers that by passing through Meemaw's womb, you can actually leave the town – entering into a busy city on the outside (possibly another alternate reality). Hurlan and the rest of the town soon learn of this and everyone decides to leave by passing through Meemaw. Hambrosia, meanwhile, says it feels like everyone is passing into her, and dissolves into the air (mirroring the Season 1 finale). In the city, the cast buys a new communal apartment, but Hurlan enters a room and finds another TV with stacks of video wills from his father. He puts the first tape in (labelled "took you long enough"), which shows his father pouring a can of baked beans labeled "FATE" out of the screen, which then pours out of the VCR. The tape then enters an infinite regression shot (possibly of many previous, alternate Hurlans who came before). The end credits close with the opening shot of the season, exiting the cave in the wall of Hurlan's office and his father's video will explaining that he has crossed into another alternate reality.

Using her psychic powers, Hambrosia is startled to discover that the Holler is deserted. MeeMaw then summons Hambrosia to come to her in the hospital, where she briefly assumes the form of a child before telling Hambrosia a story about the holler.
The story starts with Hurlan asking Hoss for advice after destroying his genitals with a paper shredder. Alarmed that this would mean the end of the Heartshe bloodline, Hoss orders Hurlan to steal some of Hoss's old semen from a sperm bank. Knowing Hurlan lacks the drive to pull off a successful heist, he also orders Hurlan to smoke the blood of a black man, which will fill him with a lust for theft. However, Hurlan blows instead of sucks, creating a bubble of blood that floats out of the office with Hurlan in fast pursuit.
Meanwhile, Sheriff is rejected by Hurshe, who is more interested in hooking to make money. Dejected, Sheriff returns home to Hambrosia, who tells Sheriff that MeeMaw wants the two of them to have a baby. Although Hambrosia is barren, she has hired her sister, Hurshe, to be their surrogate, although she insists it be done surgically.
In the hospital, Doc combines Sheriff's semen with Hambrosia's eggs. After Doc puts the resulting goo into Hurshe, she immediately gives birth to a giant, glowing, yellow maggot, with which she feels an immediate and very intense bond. She refuses to give it up, planning to peddle the creature's love to her Johns in order to afford a high class singing bass.
Hurlan, meanwhile, keeps chasing the bubble of blood hither and thither until he throws up and collapses in exhaustion.
We return to the A plot by learning that Hurshe's glowing maggot of love is so popular, there is a three month waiting list to see Hurshe. Her walls are covered with singing bass. Unfortunately, Hurshe arrives home to discover her baby maggot is missing. It has been kidnapped by Hambrosia, who hastily hides the baby maggot in a pot when Sheriff comes home. Thinking the pot contains stew, Sheriff turns the stove on to get it hot, cooking his own baby maggot son.
Still telling Hambrosia this story, MeeMaw says that Hambrosia was meant to keep the baby maggot safe until MeeMaw summoned Hambrosia (in another story flashback) to reveal a dreadful secret: MeeMaw must shed her current body in order to avoid a catastrophic event called "The Comening." She plans to put her spirit in the body of the bug baby, unaware that it has been cooked.
Hambrosia hurries home to discover that the cooked baby bug is gone. Hurshe, after breaking in to search for her child, grows so hungry that she eats the baby bug stew, not knowing what it is. She later takes a massive and painful dump.
Hurlan, meanwhile, is down in the dumps, after being unable to capture the blood bubble. After giving up, the blood bubble approaches him and steals his wallet, which we later see in the hands of MeeMaw, who tells Hambrosia that her mistake has cost MeeMaw her mortality. Hambrosia says that this is impossible, but MeeMaw says impossible things become possible when their surrounding reality is also impossible. We flashback to the hospital from the beginning of the episode to discover that there are two Heartshe Holler realities. In each one, MeeMaw is telling a story of the other one, so each reality creates the other, which is impossible, meaning MeeMaw's death -- once just impossible -- is now impossibly impossible. In other words, possible.
This revelation gives Hambrosia a headache. Understandably.
At this point, a giant bug crawls out of Hurshe's toilet. It has the Confederate flag on its wings, and MeeMaw's head. It flies up to the screen and says, "The Comening."

Thinking Hoss is saving his juiciest secrets for the end of his video will, Hurlan skips ahead to the very last tape. Before Hoss can reveal any secrets, however, Hurlan falls asleep. Annoyed, Hoss changes his own channel to a station showing "Wake Up, White People," a racist talk show hosted by Jacket. His first guest is MeeMaw, who vociferously warns the holler about an upcoming catastrophe (The Comening) that can only be averted by sacrificing "the purest one among you." She then disappears. Literally.
Jacket takes calls from about this admonition, one of which is Doc, who tells Jacket that his wife is having sex with a black man who she was canoodling with at Oodle's House O' Noodles. This news perturbs Jacket. His producer reminds him that the call was a plug planted as part of a nested marketing strategy, but Jacket worries the part about his wife was true.
Meanwhile, the rest of the townsfolk are at the bar, worried about the Comening. They believe that the "purest one" among them must be the child-like Hurlan. They go to Hurlan at night and chop off his head.
Jacket, wanting to soothe his troubled head, goes to Hurshe for sexual healing (which involves nested marketing for beef stew). At the same time, Jacket's producer is banging Jacket's wife. Post-coitus, he mentions a new type of "holistic" marketing that he's been working on.
Partying at the bar for averting the curse, the townsfolk are surprised to discover that Hurlan is walking around with his head in one hand, apparently still alive. They realize he is too dumb to know how to die. Disgusted, they decide they must use education (their worst enemy) in order to smarten Hurlan to death.
After sex, Jacket discovers a brand-shaped blister on his lip. Hurshe reveals this is part of a sexually-transmitted marketing strategy concocted by Jacket's producer. When she informs Jacket that his wife is sleeping with his producer, Jacket says he is going to kill him.
The townsfolk try to educate Hurlan, but nothing works until Hurlan accidentally electrocutes his severed head with a carton of milk, which turns him into a genius.
Jacket goes to Grub's Guns but cannot afford any of the weapons. Grub says he will give Jacket 50% all guns if Jacket kills his wife and producer live on the air and mentions Grub's gun shop as a nested marketing strategy for his killing spree.
Hurlan uses his new-found genius to extrapolate all of the holler's secrets. Foremost among them: MeeMaw is Virginia Dare, the first white person born in America, and therefore cursed by the gods of the indigenous people. "The Comening" is her attempt to avoid the curse. He is about to warn the holler, when he realizes what death is. Realizing he is still decapitated, he dies.
Hoss takes us back to "Wake Up, White People," we see that Jacket has tied and gagged his wife and producer. After plugging Grub's Guns and Uncle Sambo's Edible Gravy, he shoots his producer in the head. He plugs a sponge to remove blood from your walls, as well as a NegrNa, the DNA of a black man that you can sprinkle on crime scenes to avoid incarceration. However, to his horror, he discovers that NegrNA is made in China. Aghast, he realizes he can't kill his wife for cheating on him if he is guilty of a bigger crime: cheating his audience with inauthentic products. He hugs his weeping wife while the townsfolk dance on set with Hurlan's head, celebrating his death.
MeeMaw then politely informs us that the death of the innocent one actually beckons the Comening, rather than prevents it. "The false prophecy has been self-fulfilled," she says before very clearly not brushing her teeth.
