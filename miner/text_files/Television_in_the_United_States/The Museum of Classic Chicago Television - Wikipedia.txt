The Museum of Classic Chicago Television (also known as FuzzyMemories.TV) is an online museum dedicated to the preservation of Chicago television broadcasts. Most of the museum's footage originates from "airchecks" of local Chicago channels (and to a lesser extent other cities) that were recorded primarily in the 1970s and 1980s. The registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation displays on its website more than 4000 clips of commercials, news broadcasts, PSAs, bumpers, obscure specials, moments of technical difficulties and other off-air recording excerpts, as well as occasional master tapes donated by former television employees.
