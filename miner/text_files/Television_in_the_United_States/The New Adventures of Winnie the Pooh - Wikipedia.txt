Overview[edit]
The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh first aired in January 1988 on The Disney Channel.[1] The show moved to ABC in September of that same year. For the 1989-90 season, it was paired with Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears (which had moved from NBC) as the Gummi Bears-Winnie the Pooh Hour. After the final regular episode was shown in October 1991, reruns continued to air on ABC until September 4, 1993. On December 9, 1995, before Disney took over ABC's Saturday Morning programming, The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh was brought back in reruns (except for a brief period in the 1996-97 season), in which it aired until September 7, 2002. The Disney Channel began reruns of the series on October 3, 1994,[2] which continued to air until September 1, 2006. The show also aired on Playhouse Disney from 1999 to 2006, as well as on Toon Disney from the channel's launch in April 1998 until November 2004. In the UK, the program aired from 2000 to 2011 on Playhouse Disney. Although the series is set in Ashdown Forest/Hartfield in East Sussex, there are various Americanisms. Starting February 2017, reruns of the show are currently being aired on Disney Junior in such countries in Europe such as: Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Russia, France and Asian countries like Japan and South Korea. Reruns of the show in Germany, Croatia and Czech Republic are being broadcast in HD, with optimization of 16:9 ratio on Disney Junior HD.
In some countries, this show had been a part of The Disney Afternoon lineup.
The show featured a number of original songs, including "Here We Go Floating" from the episode "Balloonatics".[3]
