Background[edit]
The 1928 one act play written by J. Hartley Manners was the first television drama.[1][2][3] It was a radio drama adapted for television.[4][5][6] It was made for television in 1928 by New York station "WGY Television" (W2XAD) using a multiple-camera setup and was broadcast at 13:30 and 23:30 on 11 September 1928.[7] The cameras picked up the stage action and microphones picked up the sound.[8] The television signal was received at several points throughout New York City and was believed to have reached the Pacific Coast. The broadcast received much publicity.[9]
The teleplay starred retired star actress Izetta Jewell. It was noted that in the television receivers she appeared trimmer than in real life and that television made a woman look slimmer and younger. A newspaper article of the time pointed out that even the heavy set opera singer Ernestine Schumann-Heink would look like a charming slender woman if on television.[4] The co-star of the television play was Maurice Randall, appearing as a John Bull type Englishman.[4]




Three inch early television receiver


Plot[edit]
A British diplomat has a romantic encounter with a mysterious woman. She is secretly trying to obtain the documents he is carrying.
Television receivers[edit]
The televised play was received on televisions that were octagonally shaped. The television set was about fourteen inches high and ten inches in depth. The front panel upper part had a three inch square aperture through which the moving picture was viewed. There were knobs on the lower part which controlled how the radio signals for the television part were received.[4]
Six televisions were set up around the W G Y studios for the newspaper reporters that were connected by closed circuit television. There were television receivers set up in the transmitting control rooms that received the signal from the air that was transmitted several miles away.[4]
Special effects[edit]
Special techniques had to be devised to show the action movements on a three inch television screen display. One was where the likeness of a character was shown to the audience instead of the real person. The facial movements of this figure were then presented in sync with the sound of the spoken parts. This sound part came from a separate radio receiver, that was placed under the television receiver.[10]
To show the action parts of the play, special effect props were developed. One example was where the Queen's messenger took a drink of wine – a wine glass appeared and a liquid poured into it from a long-neck bottle. Other props used for the play were watch dials, keys, revolvers, and stacks of documents. The stage for the play consisted of three spotlights, three scanning machines, three microphones, background scenes and other apparatus. The director of these props that coordinated everything was Mortimer Steward.[4]
Drawbacks[edit]
The transmission was a test of General Electric's 48-line television system and lasted 40 minutes.[11] Ernst Alexanderson was the electrical engineer that developed the mechanics of coordinating the sound and moving images that was the beginning of the "radio movie" that developed into the soap opera.[7][12][13] The received radio drama play tended to shift to the right or left of the center of the television screen. This was due to the variation in the speed of the motor used to drive the scanning disc that picked up the image on the stage. The pictures at the receiving end also flickered somewhat, similarly to the hand-cranked silent movies presented at theaters at the time.[4]

The first occurred on 11 September 1928, conducted by General Electric from their Schenectady, NY station – to test Ernst Alexanderson's new 48-line television system. The play was "The Queen's Messenger", a melodramatic piece by London-born J. Hartley Manners. Arguably it was a more adventuresome production in that it used three cameras. Director, Mortimer Stewart, mixed the feeds in a control box. However, only four Octagonal GE receivers were tuned in.
