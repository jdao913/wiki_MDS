The Real is an American syndicated talk show. The series initially received a trial run on Fox owned markets in the summer of 2013. The series was developed as a talk show designed to appeal to younger female viewers who, like the co-hosts, were experiencing new events in their lives. It was green-lit for national syndication later that fall and officially premiered the following year.

In February 2015, Warner Bros. announced the series had been renewed for a second season.[6] In October 2015, the series was renewed for a third and fourth seasons, allowing it to air through 2018.[7][8]. In July 2017, the show announced that, for its fourth season, it will begin airing live broadcasts, with reruns airing on VH1 starting September 18, 2017.
