Story[edit]
A black English nobleman named Desmond Pfeiffer, chased out of England due to gambling debts, becomes President Abraham Lincoln's valet. In the show, he serves as the intelligent and erudite backbone of a Civil War-era White House populated by louts and drunkards.
Characters[edit]

Desmond Pfeiffer (/ˈdɛzmən(d) pəˈfaɪfər/; DEZ-mən(d) pə-FY-fər) (Chi McBride) – Black English gentleman serving as President Lincoln's butler.
Abraham Lincoln (Dann Florek) – 16th President of the United States.
Mary Todd Lincoln (Christine Estabrook) – President Lincoln's wife.
Nibblet (Max Baker) – Pfeiffer's assistant
Ulysses S. Grant (Kelly Connell) – General of the United States Army.

Controversy[edit]
Before the series' premiere, several African American activist groups, including the Los Angeles area NAACP, protested against the premise of the series. On September 24, 1998, a protest against the series was held outside Paramount Studios. Five days later, UPN released a statement regarding the controversy and stated that the network planned on delaying the controversial pilot episode (which never aired) and would instead air an alternate episode in its place. The first episode of the series aired on October 5, 1998, ranking 116th out of 125 television programs for that week. Desmond Pfeiffer was removed from UPN's schedule on October 24 and, after airing one episode two days after being removed from UPN's lineup, was canceled.[2]
Legacy[edit]
In 2002, TV Guide listed the show as the eleventh-worst TV series ever,[3] and in 2010 TV Guide Network listed the show at #15 on their list of 25 Biggest TV Blunders.[4] Film Threat's Phil Hall gave the show a positive review, writing, "Today, the show is remembered (barely) as a bizarre flop – but after watching a pair of episodes that are currently available for YouTube viewing, I would be bold enough to declare that “The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer” deserves a new consideration. [...] If you have the patience for crass, innuendo-laced, no-taste bawdy comedy, you will certainly find yourself laughing out loud over this series."[5]
The series was alluded to multiple times in the unaired pilot episode of Clerks: The Animated Series, "Leonardo Leonardo Returns and Dante Has an Important Decision to Make", which featured Dante and Randal drawing inspiration from a non-existent episode of The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer, which Randal describes as "classic Pfeiffer".[5]
