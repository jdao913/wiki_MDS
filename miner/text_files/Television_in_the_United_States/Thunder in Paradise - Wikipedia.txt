Series concept[edit]
Thunder in Paradise follows the adventures of two ex-Navy SEALS, Randolph J. "Hurricane" Spencer and Martin "Bru" Brubaker, who work as mercenaries out of their tropical resort headquarters along Florida's Gulf Coast. Using their futuristic, high-tech boat, nicknamed "Thunder", they travel around the world fighting various criminals and villains. However, they are forced to balance their dangerous undercover work with their responsibilities of raising widower Spencer's young daughter Jessica, who lives with them.
Former model Kelly LaRue, who owns and manages the "Scuttlebutt Bar N' Grill" on the beach in front of the resort, looks after Jessica whenever Spence and Bru go on their missions. Kelly also serves as a romantic foil for Bru. Edward Whitaker, Jessica's uncle, owns the beach resort and makes semi-regular appearances in the series, primarily for comic relief.

The pilot movie was originally released on home video the week of September 27, 1993. It was not broadcast on television until the beginning of Season 1, after which it was split into two episodes for reruns and later syndication.
The two-part episode "Sealed with a Kismet" was combined and released to home video as the feature Thunder in Paradise II.
The two-part episode "Deadly Lessons" was combined and released to home video as the feature Thunder in Paradise 3.
The two-part episode "The M.A.J.O.R. and the Minor" was used as the basis for the Thunder in Paradise CD-i interactive game. In addition to the episode itself, additional footage was filmed for use at different stages in the game. This game-exclusive footage was shot at the same time as the episode itself.[2] (Another video game based on Thunder in Paradise, this one from Software Toolworks, was announced for the Super NES and Genesis,[2] but never released.)

DVD release[edit]
On September 26, 2006, Lionsgate released a 3-disc Thunder in Paradise Collection that contained Thunder in Paradise ("Thunder In Paradise" Parts 1 & 2), Thunder in Paradise II ("Sealed with a Kismet" Parts 1 & 2), and Thunder in Paradise 3 ("Deadly Lessons" Part 1 & 2).
Filming locations[edit]
The Thunder in Paradise pilot movie was filmed in and around the historic Don CeSar Hotel in St. Pete Beach, Florida during April 1993. When the series was picked up for a full season, the production company then moved to Disney's Hollywood Studios near Orlando, where the primary filming location became the Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa at the Walt Disney World Resort. Other filming locations at Walt Disney World included Disney's Old Key West Resort, Fort Wilderness Campground, and EPCOT, used heavily due to the wide variety of futuristic and architectural styles available at that theme park. The destruction of the school featured in the two-part episode "Deadly Lessons" was an actual controlled demolition of a school building in Central Florida that the production company agreed to perform in exchange for filming rights. Stetson University in DeLand, Florida was utilized for an episode.[3]
