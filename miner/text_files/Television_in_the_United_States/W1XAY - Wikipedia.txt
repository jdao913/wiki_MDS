W1XAY was one of the first television stations in the world, being founded on June 14, 1928. It was also branded as "WLEX" from its sister radio station, in Lexington, Massachusetts, United States (near Boston).
The television station broadcast at 3,500 kHz, with 48 vertical lines of resolution, and 18 frames per second. It shut down in March 1930.
The station was owned by the Boston Post, which also owned WLEX.
The WLEX call letters are now on the NBC affiliate on channel 18 in Lexington, Kentucky.
