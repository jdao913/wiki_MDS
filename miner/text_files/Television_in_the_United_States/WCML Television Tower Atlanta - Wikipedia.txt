The WCML-TV Tower Atlanta, also known as the WCMU-TV Tower Atlanta, was a 1,349.1-foot (411.21 m) tall guyed mast for the transmission of radio and television programs located 9.89 miles (15.91 km) north of the unincorporated city of Atlanta, Michigan in Montmorency Township. The structure, owned by Central Michigan University, had been the tallest human construction in the state of Michigan from its completion in 1975 until its replacement with a newer, but shorter tower, standing 1,177 feet (358.8 m) tall, in 2010. This tower was (as is the current tower) used by WCMU-TV and WCMU-FM to broadcast their signals. The new tower is not the tallest tower in Michigan with several being taller, including: WJMN-TV[1] (at 1,252 feet (382 m)), WFQX-TV [2] (at 1,290.4 feet (393.3 m)), and WEYI-TV [3] (at 1,322.9 feet (403.2 m)).
