The WIVB-TV Tower is a 321.9-metre-tall (1,056 ft) guyed steel mast located at 8242 Center Street in Colden, New York, United States.[1] The tower, which is also known as LIN TV Tower, was completed in 1948 and is used by WIVB for TV broadcasting and by WTSS 102.5FM for radio broadcasting. WIVB will cease using the tower in 2018 as it begins sharing its signal with sister station WNLO.
At the time of its completion, it was the second-tallest structure in the world.[citation needed]
The tower is located in a farm field and fenced off near the entrance from Center Street. There is second shorter tower located next to it that is the original tower from 1948.
