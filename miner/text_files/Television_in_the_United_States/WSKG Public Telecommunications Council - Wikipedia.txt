The WSKG Public Telecommunications Council, Inc. (WSKG, Inc.) is the name of a non-profit Public Broadcasting organisation serving Central, Western, and the Southern Tier of New York State, and Northeast Pennsylvania, with offices based in Vestal (Binghamton).
WSKG, Inc. owns and operates the following stations:

WSKG-TV, a PBS member station operating on analog channel 46, digital 42; repeated in digital on WSKA-DT channel 30 in Corning, New York
WSKG-FM, an NPR member station featuring news and public affairs, plus classical music
WSQX-FM, an NPR member station featuring news and public affairs from NPR, Pacifica, and other sources, plus jazz music.

Due to the hilly terrain of the Southern Tier region, WSKG's radio stations are retransmitted on various repeaters and translators throughout the region. WSKG originally also had a network of low-powered television repeaters as well, but were shut down due to high costs.
WSKG, Inc. is also a license holder for WIOX in Roxbury, New York.
