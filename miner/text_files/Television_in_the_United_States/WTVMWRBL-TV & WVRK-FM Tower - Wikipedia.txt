At the time of its completion during 1962, the WTVM/WRBL-TV & WVRK-FM Tower was the tallest structure in the world. However, during 1963 WIMZ-FM-Tower in Knoxville, Tennessee, USA exceeded it.
Presently, despite being comparable in height to the Willis Tower in Chicago, the WTVM/WRBL-TV & WVRK-FM Tower is not even the tallest structure in Cusseta, Georgia. During 2005, the Cusseta Richland Towers Tower, a 538.2 meter guyed mast situated at 32°19′16.4″N, 84°47′28.2″W, surpassed it in height.
