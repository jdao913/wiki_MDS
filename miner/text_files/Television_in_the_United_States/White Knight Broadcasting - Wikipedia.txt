White Knight Broadcasting is a company based in Lafayette, Louisiana owning seven stations, based in Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. It was founded in 1995.
On April 24, 2013, as part of the sale of White Knight Broadcasting's partner Communications Corporation of America to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group, White Knight announced the sale of its entire group to Mission Broadcasting (except for KSHV-TV, which would be sold to a female-controlled company called Rocky Creek Communications), with Nexstar taking over the operations of the stations through shared services agreements.[citation needed] The deal was later withdrawn, and White Knight retained ownership of the stations although Nexstar had inherited the SSAs.
Background[edit]
Malara Enterprises was the parent company of White Knight Broadcasting. White Knight owns or operates seven stations:

KTPN-LD and KLPN-LP, Tyler-Longview-Lufkin, Texas
KFXK-TV and KFXL-LP, Tyler-Longview-Lufkin, Texas
KSHV-TV, Shreveport, Louisiana
WVLA-TV, Baton Rouge, Louisiana

It also previously owned KKWB (now KTFN) in El Paso, Texas and KZUP-CD in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. KKWB, a WB affiliate at the time, was sold in 2002 to Entravision Communications, which converted the station to TeleFutura. KZUP, an independent low-power television station, was sold to Nexstar in 2016.
