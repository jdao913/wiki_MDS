History[edit]
Al Jazeera Media Network entered the European television rights market in June 2011 when it purchased a package of live French football Ligue 1 matches from 2012 to 2016 for €90 million a year. The deal makes them joint broadcasters of domestic top-flight football in France alongside long-term rights holders Canal+.[7] The broadcaster also acquired the pay-TV rights to the UEFA Champions League, Europa League from 2012 to 2015, Euro 2012 and Euro 2016 in France.[8][9][10] France was targeted as Al Jazeera's first entry into Europe due to the fact that there were no dedicated sports channels, unlike in the United Kingdom.[11]
The name "beIN Sports" was first revealed in early 2012. According to Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the director of Al Jazeera Sports, the name "symbolises the mind of two channels aiming at bringing live and exclusive broadcasting of the biggest events."[12] Former Canal+ executive Charles Bietry was hired by Al Jazeera to launch the channels.[13] The channels will be available on all cable and IPTV providers and select satellite providers.[14] CanalSat – owned by Canal+ Group – has declined to carry the channels as of March 2012.[15]
beIN Sports 1 launched on June 1, 2012 in time to broadcast Euro 2012.[16] beIN Sports 2 launched on July 27, 2012 in time to broadcast the French Ligue 2 season, and before the start of the 2012–13 Ligue 1 season.[16]

Football[edit]
In France, beIN Sports holds one of five rights packages for Ligue 1 from 2012 to 2016 – the package consisting of Friday night and Sunday evening matches. The other four packages are held by Canal+.[7] It also shows Ligue 2 matches. For the UEFA Champions League, it has the rights to broadcast all matches except the 13 weekly first-choice picks (yet to be awarded to any broadcaster as of April 2012) from 2012 to 2015.[8] It also owns the rights to all UEFA Europa League matches including the final from 2012 to 2015.[9]
Also in France, beIN Sports and Canal+ also share the rights to Serie A and Bundesliga matches.[21] It also airs FA Cup, Football League Championship, La Liga, Argentine Primera División[22] and Brasileirao.

beIN Sports bought the broadcasting rights of Turkish Süper Lig.[25]
The channel's football coverage is notably fronted by Richard Keys and Andy Gray, who moved to Doha after they were sacked from Sky Sports. The pair's trademark easy banter has proved popular with viewers of beIN's English language services.
Their appointment saw the Monday Night Football brand, regarded as revolutionary when it was devised by the presenters in the 1990s, take a place in the channel's schedule.
Keys and Gray also present an eponymous magazine style show on Friday evenings, and have attracted praise for the variety and quality of proper football men featured on the show.

Distribution[edit]
The channels will be dominated by football coverage. beIN Sports 1 HD will focus on year-round live football with the Premier League being prominent as well as content from Arsenal, Liverpool and Spurs club channels. Other live coverage will come from the Serie A, Ligue 1, Major League Soccer (MLS), the Brazilian national leagues (Paulistao & Brasileirão), as well as major cup tournaments such as the FA Cup, Coppa Italia, and the Coupe de la Ligue. beIN Sports 2 HD will also feature live football but will have a wider sports remit. beIN Sports Premier League HD will be a 24-hour Premier League-dedicated channel in Indonesia broadcasting nearly 1,600 hours of live programming each season. This includes all 380 Premier League matches per season, weekly magazine show Premier League World, as well as pre-match coverage and post-game analysis in addition to weekly preview and review shows and highlights.[30]
Canada[edit]
Despite most of its North American broadcast rights contracts covering both the United States and Canada, beIN Sports initially was not authorized to broadcast in Canada nor had it sub-licensed any of its programmings to Canadian broadcasters. The channel had a difficult time finding a Canadian broadcaster willing to partner up with it to launch its services in Canada. Due to the regulatory environment in Canada, the only way to launch beIN Sports in Canada is by launching a Canadian version of the channel via a partnership with a Canadian broadcaster. In October 2013, beIN Sports launched an online streaming service in Canada through their website www.beINsportsplay.ca. The live service was available at no charge for registered users until 1 February 2014; since then, users can access the streams for 19.99 CAD/month. On-demand coverage is not available through beIN Sports Play Canada.[31]
On 18 December 2013, beIN Sports announced they had reached a deal with Ethnic Channels Group, a local ethnic broadcaster, to launch their services in Canada.[32] The channel officially launched on 31 January 2014 via MTS and NEXTV.
beIN Sports HD is available on Shaw Cable on channel 234,[33] Rogers Cable on channel 391,[34] on Bell Satellite & Fibe on channel 1412,[35] and on Videotron on channel 797.
Sports events broadcasting rights and related controversies[edit]
beIN Sports has acquired broadcasting rights for many major sports events, including the agreement with the International Olympic Committee on the exclusivity to broadcast Olympic Games between 2018 and 2024 for Middle East and North Africa[36] and agreement on global rights for tennis events with the International Tennis Federation.[37]
There were also several disputes and conflicts regarding rights owned by beIN Sports. French radio stations decided to decline deal with beIN on radio rights for the 2017 World Handball Championships as beIN Sports wanted them to pay administrative fees about five times higher than the real technical cost, constituting hidden radio rights which are prohibited by French law for this case.[38] North Africa's television companies were unable to make deal with beIN Sports on 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in football. Four of the region's countries, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Egypt, had their teams qualified for the tournament. Non-existent deal prevented broadcasting the teams' matches in their countries on free-to-air TV channels.[39]
In 2014, beIN Sports had a conflict with English Premier League over the mutual agreement on broadcasting rights as beIN Sports was accused of piracy broadcasting and its rights were restricted.[40]
In 2016, French free market watchdog rejected the rights distribution deal between beIN Sports and Canal+. According to the authority, the deal would leave 80 percent of the rights in the country in the hands of both organizations creating a thread of free market competition.[41]
