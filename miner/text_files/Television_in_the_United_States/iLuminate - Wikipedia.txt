iLuminate is a theatrical and technology based company in New York, New York, best known for competing in the sixth season of America's Got Talent. They finished in third place.[1][2][3][4]
The dancers were dressed in black and performed in the dark, but audience members were able to see them because the dancers' suits were covered in a mixture of electroluminescent wire and LEDs; the flashing lights that all the dancers wore were synchronized to display various effects.
