Adventure Time is an American animated television series created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo. Throughout the series, they interact with the show's other main characters: Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch), the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom; the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), a demented but largely misunderstood ice wizard; Marceline the Vampire Queen (voiced by Olivia Olson), a thousand-year-old vampire and rock music enthusiast; Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Ward), a melodramatic and immature princess made out of "irradiated stardust"; BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), a sentient video game console-shaped robot that lives with Finn and Jake; and Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), a flame elemental and ruler of the Fire Kingdom.[1][2] The pilot first aired in 2007 on Nicktoons Network,[3] where it was later re-aired on the incubator series Random! Cartoons.[4][5] The pilot eventually leaked onto the internet and became a cult hit on YouTube.[6] After Nickelodeon declined to turn the short into a full-fledged show, Cartoon Network purchased the rights, and Adventure Time launched as a series on April 5, 2010.[7][8]
Each Adventure Time episode is about eleven minutes in length; pairs of episodes are often telecast in order to fill a half-hour program time slot.[9] For the first five seasons, the show aired on Monday nights.[nb 1] However, starting with the early sixth-season episode "Breezy", the show began to shift both its timeslot and its day of airing.[10] Ever since its debut, Adventure Time has been a ratings success for Cartoon Network, with the highest-rated episodes scoring over 3 million viewers. The show has received positive reviews from critics and has developed a strong following among teenagers and adults, many of whom are attracted due to the series' animation, stories, and characters.[11] Adventure Time has won three Annie Awards,[12] seven Primetime Emmy Awards,[13] two British Academy Children's Awards,[14][15] a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award,[16] a Pixel Award,[17] a Peabody Award,[18] and a Kerrang! Award.[19] The series has also been nominated for three Critics' Choice Television Awards,[20][21][22] two Annecy Festival Awards,[23][24] a TCA Award,[25] and a Sundance Film Festival Award,[26] among others. Several compilation DVDs have been released. In addition, the first seven seasons have been released on DVD, and the first six have been released on Blu-ray. Adventure Time is produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Frederator Studios.

^* It should be noted that, in regards to the production-side of things, the show's seventh season was originally supposed to comprise episodes "Bonnie & Neddy" though "Reboot" (for a total of 39 episodes),[nb 2] its eighth season was supposed to comprise the episodes "Two Swords" through "Three Buckets" (for a total of 28 episodes),[nb 3] and its ninth season was supposed to comprise the episodes "The Wild Hunt" through the series finale.[33] However, when it came time to upload the seventh season onto streaming sites like CartoonNetwork.com, Cartoon Network split the seventh season into parts, ending it with "The Thin Yellow Line."[34] This new episode count for the season was cemented by the release of the complete seventh season DVD on July 18, 2017, which included episodes "Bonnie & Neddy" through "The Thin Yellow Line".[35] The network then began counting episodes "Broke His Crown" through the Islands miniseries as making up season eight,[36] "Orb" through "Three Buckets" as making up season nine,[nb 4] and "The Wild Hunt" through the series finale as season ten.[nb 5]

Notes[edit]


^ An exception to this is the third season episode "Thank You" which aired on a Wednesday as a holiday special.
^ This is based on the fact that, in the past, Muto had explicitly referred to "Preboot"/"Reboot" as being the original season seven finale episodes.[29] Furthermore, an image that hung in showrunner Adam Muto's office includes a listing of episodes "Bonnie & Neddy" through "Reboot", explicitly identifying them all as season seven episodes.[30]
^ This is based on two facts: first, the official Adventure Time production blog announced in January 2017 that "Two Swords"/"Do No Harm" collectively made up the eighth season premiere.[31] Second, Adam Muto explicitly confirmed that "Three Buckets" was envisioned as the season eight finale by the production crew prior to "the official season divisions [having been] moved around."[32]
^ On Cartoon Network's videos webpage, "Orb" is explicitly listed as the first episode of season nine.[27]
^ On Cartoon Network's videos webpage, "The Wild Hunt" is explicitly listed as the first episode of season ten.[27]
^ The pilot initially was aired as a stand-alone short on Nicktoons Network January 11, 2007,[3][38] before it was re-aired as part of the Nicktoons' series Random! Cartoons on December 7, 2008.[5] As such, the original, stand-alone 2007 air date is included here.
^ David C. Smith storyboarded the final act, but is credited only as revisionist.[80]
^ Larry Leichliter served as director for the first part of the season, before the title was phased out solely in favor of "supervising director".[116]
^ On the credit screen for the episode "Davey", it is stated that the episode was storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Skyler Page. However, this is erroneous, and the episode was actually storyboarded by Page and Somvilay Xayaphone, according to Pendleton Ward.[123]
^ According to Rebecca Sugar, Adam Muto also contributed "additional scenes" to the episode and "did a lot on this one and put it over the top."[131]
^ "Evergreen" first aired on November 10, 2014 on Cartoon Network in Latin America.[170] "Astral Plane" was first uploaded on December 24, 2014 onto Cartoon Network's official Brazilian website.[171] "The Visitor" first aired on February 3, 2015 on Cartoon Network in South Korea.[172] "Friends Forever" and "Jermaine" aired on Cartoon Network in Latin America on April 6, 2015 and April 13, 2015 respectively.[173] However, because this field specifically refers to domestic airdates, the information here will denote when these episodes first aired in the United States.
^ The Islands miniseries was released on DVD and made available for download on iTunes and Amazon.com on January 24.[236] However, because this field specifically refers to episode airdates, the information here will denote when these eight episodes first aired on Cartoon Network.
^ Seven minutes of this episode were animated and directed by Alex & Lindsay Small-Butera.[240]
^ "Orb" was released via Cartoon Network phone App on April 14,[260] the Elements miniseries was released for download via iTunes on April 18,[261] and "Abstract" through "Three Buckets" were released via Cartoon Network phone app on July 14.[262] However, because this field specifically refers to episode airdates, the information here will denote when these fourteen episodes first aired on Cartoon Network.
^ Three sequences in this episode were animated and directed by Alex & Lindsay Small-Butera.[262]
^ Wal-Mart released a special, two-disc version of this DVD in October of 2012. This release added four new episodes (2 from season one, 1 from season two, and 1 from season four), bringing the run-time up to 176 minutes.[294]
^ This DVD is not a complete season two release, as it omits "It Came from the Nightosphere", "Death in Bloom", "Mortal Folly", and "Mortal Recoil".[301]
^ This DVD is not a complete season three release, as it omits "The Creeps", "From Bad to Worse", "No One Can Hear You", "Jake vs. Me-Mow", and "Ghost Princess".[301]
