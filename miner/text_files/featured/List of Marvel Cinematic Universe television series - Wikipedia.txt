Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013–)[edit]
Main article: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.









(L to R) Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen and Jeffrey Bell serve as the showrunners for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.


Agent Phil Coulson assembles a small team of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) agents to handle strange new cases.[7] After discovering that Project Centipede and their leader, "The Clairvoyant", were affiliated with Hydra, a terrorist organization, Coulson and his team must deal with Hydra members still at large following Hydra's infiltration of, and the destruction of, S.H.I.E.L.D., while also looking to restore trust from the government and public.[8] In the wake of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s wars with Hydra and the Inhumans, a race of superhumans, Coulson begins a secret mission to protect the world from new threats.[9] After the defeat of the Inhuman Hive and with Hydra destroyed, S.H.I.E.L.D. is made a legitimate organization once again, with Coulson returning to being a field agent, and is tasked with tracking down more enhanced people–including Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider–while Agent Leo Fitz and Dr. Holden Radcliffe complete their work on Life Model Decoys.[10] Coulson and members of his team are eventually abducted to deep space, where they must try and save humanity while figuring out how to get home.[3]
In August 2012, ABC ordered a pilot for a show called S.H.I.E.L.D., to be written by Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, and Maurissa Tancharoen, and directed by Joss Whedon.[11] On April 6, 2013, ABC announced that the show would be titled Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,[12] and it was officially ordered to series on May 10, 2013.[13] Jed Whedon, Tancharoen and Jeffrey Bell act as the series' showrunners,[1] while Clark Gregg reprises his role from the films as Phil Coulson.[14] The series was renewed for a second season on May 8, 2014,[15] a third on May 7, 2015,[16] a fourth on March 3, 2016,[17] and a fifth on May 11, 2017.[18]
The first season, which premiered on September 24, 2013,[19] aired episodes that directly relate to events in the films Thor: The Dark World and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.[20][21] The revelation in Captain America: The Winter Soldier that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been infiltrated by Hydra had a huge impact on the series. Regarding the synergy the show had with addressing events from the film, Loeb said, "It's an extremely unique experience that doesn't exist anywhere else out there in the entertainment business."[22] The second season, which premiered on September 23, 2014,[23] introduces Inhumans to the MCU,[24] ahead of their own television series.[25] Additionally, a recurring plot point in the first two seasons involved the body of a member of the Kree race, who play a significant role in Guardians of the Galaxy.[26] The third season, which premiered on September 29, 2015,[27] introduces the concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name,[28][29] as well as Life Model Decoys.[30] The fourth season, which premiered on September 20, 2016,[31] sees Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider introduced to the MCU,[32] and ties to the second season of Agent Carter and Doctor Strange.[33][34] The fifth season is scheduled to premiere on December 1, 2017.[3]
In the first season, Samuel L. Jackson,[35] Cobie Smulders,[36] Maximiliano Hernández,[37] Titus Welliver[38] and Jaimie Alexander[39] all reprise their roles as Nick Fury, Maria Hill, Jasper Sitwell, Felix Blake, and Sif, respectively, from previous MCU films and One-Shots. In the second season, Alexander and Smulders return,[40][41] while Hayley Atwell,[42] Neal McDonough, Kenneth Choi,[43] and Henry Goodman[44][45] also reprise their roles as Peggy Carter, Timothy "Dum Dum" Dugan, Jim Morita, and List, respectively, from previous MCU films. In the third season, William Sadler reprises his role as Matthew Ellis from the MCU films,[46] and Powers Boothe recurs as his previously unnamed The Avengers character, Gideon Malick.[47]
Marvel's Agent Carter (2015–16)[edit]
Main article: Agent Carter (TV series)
In 1946, Peggy Carter must balance the routine office work she does for the Strategic Scientific Reserve while secretly assisting Howard Stark, who finds himself framed for supplying deadly weapons to enemies of the United States. Carter is assisted by Stark's butler, Edwin Jarvis, to find those responsible and dispose of the weapons.[48][49] Carter eventually moves from New York City to Los Angeles to deal with the threats of the new atomic age in the wake of World War II, gaining new friends, a new home and potential new love.[50]
By September 2013, Marvel was developing a series inspired by the Agent Carter One-Shot, featuring Peggy Carter,[51] and in January 2014, the series was confirmed to be in development, with the script for a potential pilot to be written by Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America: The Winter Soldier writers Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely.[52] On May 8, 2014, ABC officially ordered Marvel's Agent Carter to series.[15] Tara Butters, Michele Fazekas and Chris Dingess act as showrunners on the series,[4][52] while Hayley Atwell reprises her role from the films as Peggy Carter.[52] The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015,[16] and was officially canceled by ABC on May 12, 2016.[53]
The first season, which premiered on January 6, 2015,[54] introduces the origins of the Black Widow and Winter Soldier programs, which both appear in several MCU films.[55][56][57] The second season, which premiered on January 19, 2016,[58] features the Darkforce, which ties to the character Marcus Daniels in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Doctor Strange.[59]
In the first season, Dominic Cooper reprise his role of Howard Stark from Captain America: The First Avenger.[60] James D'Arcy portrays Edwin Jarvis,[61] Stark's butler in the series who eventually serves as inspiration for Tony Stark's artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S.[62] Costa Ronin portrays a young Anton Vanko, the co-creator of the arc reactor with Stark.[63] Chris Evans appears as Steve Rogers / Captain America via archive footage from The First Avenger.[64] McDonough and Toby Jones reprise their roles as Dugan and Arnim Zola, respectively.[65][66] In the second season, Cooper returns to reprise his role.[67]
Marvel's Inhumans (2017)[edit]
Main article: Inhumans (TV series)




Scott Buck serves as showrunner for both Inhumans on ABC and the first season of Iron Fist on Netflix.


After a military coup, the Inhuman Royal Family, led by Black Bolt, escape to Hawaii where they must save themselves and the world.[68]
In November 2016, Marvel Television and IMAX Corporation announced Marvel's Inhumans, to be produced in conjunction with ABC Studios.[25][69] The series' first two episodes were filmed entirely on IMAX digital cameras,[70] and premiered on IMAX screens on September 1, 2017, for two weeks.[5] ABC will then broadcast the series weekly starting with the first two episodes on September 29, 2017,[5] with the network airing of the first two episodes featuring exclusive content, outside of the versions screened on IMAX.[25] Select action sequences in the rest of the series were also shot on IMAX.[70] The series was neither intended to be a reworking of the planned film from Marvel Studios, nor a spin-off from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.[71] Ben Sherwood, president of Disney–ABC Television Group, added that "We’ve worked very carefully with our friends at Marvel Studios—and this is a critical point—to make sure that calendar-wise and content-wise we are only enhancing" the MCU; the theatrical debut of the series was timed to not interfere with the release of any Marvel Studios films.[72] In December 2016, Scott Buck was announced as showrunner and executive producer for the series.[6] In February 2017, Anson Mount was cast as Black Bolt.[69] Filming began in March 2017 in Hawaii,[73] and concluded in June.[74]

In April 2016, the ABC-owned network Freeform announced a straight-to-series order for Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, based on the characters of the same name,[182] calling it their "first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and describing the show as a "superhero love story".[183] In January 2017, Olivia Holt and Aubrey Joseph were cast as Tandy Bowen / Dagger and Tyrone Johnson / Cloak, respectively.[184] Joe Pokaski serves as showrunner for the series.[181] Filming began in New Orleans in February 2017,[185] and concluded in November 2017.[186] The first season, consisting of 10 episodes,[180] is set to air in 2018.[181]
Roxxon Oil is seen in the series.[187]

Marvel's New Warriors[edit]
Main article: New Warriors (TV series)
Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl, Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal, Dwayne Taylor / Night Thrasher, Robbie Baldwin / Speedball, Zach Smith / Microbe, and Deborah Fields / Debrii,[189] are superpowered young people with abilities very different from the Avengers, who want to make a positive impact in the world even if they are not quite ready to be heroes.[188]
By the end of August 2016, Marvel Television and ABC Studios were developing a half-hour comedy series based on the New Warriors featuring Squirrel Girl, with the series being offered to cable networks and streaming outlets.[190] In April 2017, Freeform announced a straight-to-series order for Marvel's New Warriors, with Kevin Biegel serving as the series' showrunner and writing the first script.[188][191] In July 2017, the cast was revealed with Milana Vayntrub starring as Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl and Derek Theler as Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal.[192] In November 2017, it was announced that the series would no longer air on Freeform and was being shopped to other networks, with Marvel intent on airing the series in 2018.[193] The first season, consisting of 10 episodes, is set to air in 2018, with Biegel serving as showrunner for the series.[188][191][192]

With the release of the second season of Daredevil, Brian Lowery of Variety felt the Netflix series "have already leapfrogged ABC’s forays into the Marvel universe in terms of their appeal, in part by tapping into the avid fan base that supports pay models and doesn’t need to be spoon-fed plot points. In the process, they have demonstrated that it’s possible to deliver a credible superhero show without a lot of pyrotechnics".[271]
After the release of the first season of Luke Cage, The Atlantic's David Sims wrote on the pacing issue of Marvel's Netflix series, a common complaint to that point, stating, "After two seasons of Daredevil, one of Jessica Jones, and now one of Luke Cage, the Netflix model feels fundamentally flawed, encouraging the kind of molasses-slow plotting comic books are designed to eschew. The problem isn’t that these shows are bad, necessarily... But they all take far too long to get going, by which point many viewers will have already tuned out." He felt one of the problems was the fact that Netflix does not rely on viewers tuning into a particular series as broadcast series do each week, but rather subscribers who, if they lose interest, "can take as long as they want to catch up... as long as they keep paying their subscription fee every month." The Netflix series are also afforded the opportunity to explore elements in more detail, with Sims noting "A lot of this detail [is] good, but it could have been considerably compressed—none of the Marvel Netflix series, so far, would have lost much by being squeezed into 10 episodes, or even 8. If Netflix shaved the 60-minute running time down quite a bit, it would likely inspire more economical—and better—storytelling from its shows." Sims concluded by saying, "What’s most frustrating of all is that Netflix isn’t getting rid of this approach anytime soon. Daredevil season three, Jessica Jones season two, Iron Fist, and The Punisher are all on their way, and each will follow the same 13-episode structure... The only respite may come in the form of The Defenders, a planned crossover series... over the course of just eight episodes. Who knows? The show might even surprise viewers and explain its villain’s motivations within the first hour. Until then, fans will be stuck needlessly giving over entire days to these series, while others are deterred from watching at all."[272] In her review for the first season of Iron Fist, Allison Keene of Collider.com spoke more on the pacing of Marvel's Netflix series, stating, "By focusing so intently on making these series... much more grounded in a gritty real world than what we typically expect from a superhero show (like DC's candy-colored [Arrowverse] on The CW), the problem is that they miss out on the key element: this should be fantastical entertainment."[273] With The Defenders, Jeff Jansen of Entertainment Weekly felt many improvements were made to the general complaints the previous seasons received. He said, "The Defenders is far from perfect. But it’s an enjoyable superhero adventure distinguished by improvements and innovations that I hope Marvel will carry forward. Shorter seasons. More team-ups. Fewer shows. Start the consolidation by letting go of Iron Fist. If Danny Rand must persist, add him to the other shows and let the stronger players carry him."[274]
Potential projects[edit]
Marvel's Damage Control[edit]
Further information: Damage Control (comics) § Live action
The show follows the overworked, underpaid, clean up crew of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, who specialize in dealing with the aftermath of superhero conflicts, rescheduling events because of the conflicts, and retrieving lost items.[275]
In October 2015, ABC ordered a put pilot for a half-hour live-action comedy series Marvel's Damage Control, based on the comics construction company of the same name. The series is being developed by Ben Karlin for ABC Studios and Marvel Television, with Karlin also writing the script for the project and serving as executive producer.[275][276] In January 2016, ABC Entertainment president Paul Lee said Damage Control was "going to be coming out this season," seemingly implying it would air in the 2016–17 television season.[277]
Other[edit]
Marvel has been working with screenwriter John Ridley since mid-April 2015 to craft a new television series, "reinventing" an existing Marvel character or property.[278] In January 2016, Ridley confirmed that the project was "still in development". He stated that he was looking to "bring some of the socially conscious nature" of Jessica Jones and his series American Crime to the show, while also creating something that is "straight entertainment".[279] A year later, Channing Dungey revealed that Ridley's project was still progressing, with Ridley working on a rewrite of his script.[280] Ridley added that the rewrite was not because "anything didn't work the first time around", but rather trying to make sure the series does something viewers have not necessarily seen before in a superhero television series, hoping it would occupy "a space that is not currently being filled" by Marvel. He also stated that he hoped to create the series "in the near term."[281] By August 2017, Dungey was "not sure" if Ridley was still working on the project.[282]
In January 2016, Lee announced that ABC Studios was developing a second comedy series with Marvel in hope it would air on ABC,[277] while Netflix CCO Ted Sarandos stated that "all the characters in the universe could also spin out" into their own series at some point.[161] That May, Dungey said that there were "a handful of projects in development", after passing on Most Wanted and canceling Agent Carter, and that Marvel and ABC were looking "at series that would be beneficial to both brands."[283] By November 2017, Disney was developing a Marvel series specifically for release on its new streaming service, which it planned to launch before the end of 2019.[284]
Abandoned projects[edit]
Main article: Most Wanted (TV pilot)
By April 2015, Marvel was developing a spinoff series of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. The series, which was being developed by Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. executive producer Jeffrey Bell and writer Paul Zbyszewski, would be based on storylines occurring at the end of the second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and would receive its own pilot rather than a backdoor pilot.[285] Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood entered into discussions to headline the potential new series as their characters Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter, respectively.[286] By May 7, 2015, when ABC announced their series renewals and cancellations, and new series pickups, the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. spinoff was passed on.[287]
In August 2015, the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. spinoff series received new life as a reworked series, titled Marvel's Most Wanted, with a pilot order.[288] Bell and Zbyszewski once again developed the series, while also serving as co-writers of the pilot, executive producers, and showrunners, with Jeph Loeb also attached as executive producer.[289] The series would still focus on Morse and Hunter, with Palicki and Blood both attached, and was described as "a new take focusing on the same duo and their continuing adventures."[288] In May 2016, the series was passed on by ABC once again.[290]
