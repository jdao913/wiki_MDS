The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of the Government of the United Kingdom, and chairs Cabinet meetings. There is no specific date when the office of Prime Minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over a period of time.[1] The term was used in the House of Commons in 1805[2] and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s,[3][4] and in 1905 the post of Prime Minister was officially given recognition in the order of precedence.[5] Modern historians generally consider Sir Robert Walpole, who led the government of Great Britain from 1721 to 1742,[6][7] as the first Prime Minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving Prime Minister by this definition.[8] However, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was the first Prime Minister and Margaret Thatcher the longest-serving Prime Minister to have been officially referred to as such.[5][9]
Strictly, the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland) was William Pitt the Younger.[10] The first Prime Minister of the current United Kingdom (the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) was David Lloyd George,[11] although the country was not renamed officially until 1927 when Stanley Baldwin was serving as Prime Minister.[12]
Due to the gradual evolution of the post of Prime Minister, the title is applied to early Prime Ministers only retrospectively;[13] this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. Lord Bath and Lord Waldegrave are both sometimes listed as prime ministers.[14] Bath was invited to form a ministry by King George II when Henry Pelham resigned in 1746,[15] as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of William Pitt the Elder,[16] who dominated the government during the Seven Years' War. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days,[14] and Waldegrave after three.[16] Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as Prime Minister,[17] and they are not listed.

Before 1721[edit]
Further information: List of chief ministers of England and Great Britain
Before the Georgian era, the Treasury of England was led by the Lord High Treasurer.[18] By the late Tudor period, the Lord High Treasurer was regarded as one of the Great Officers of State[18] and tended to be the dominant figure in government: the Duke of Somerset, Lord High Treasurer (1547–1549),[19] served as Lord Protector to his nephew King Edward VI;[19] Lord Burghley, Lord High Treasurer (1572–1598),[20] was the dominant minister among Queen Elizabeth I's ministers;[20] Burghley's son Lord Salisbury succeeded his father as chief minister to Elizabeth I (1598–1603) and later served King James I as Lord High Treasurer (1608–1612).[21]
By the late Stuart period, the Treasury was often run not by a single individual such as a Lord High Treasurer but by a committee of Lords of the Treasury,[22] led by the First Lord of the Treasury. The last Lords High Treasurer, Lord Godolphin (1702–1710)[23] and Lord Oxford (1711–1714),[24] ran the government of Queen Anne.
After the succession of King George I in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer became permanent.[25] For the next three years, the government was headed by Lord Townshend, who was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department.[26] Subsequently, Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland ran the government jointly,[27][28] with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland managing domestic affairs.[27][28] Stanhope died in February 1721[27] and Sunderland resigned two months later;[28] Townshend and Robert Walpole were then invited to form the next government.[29][26] From that point, the holder of the office of First Lord also unofficially held the status of Prime Minister. It was not until the Edwardian era that the title Prime Minister was constitutionally recognised.[13] With only few exceptions, the Prime Minister still holds the office of First Lord by constitutional convention.[30]
