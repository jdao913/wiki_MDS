The Super Bowl is an annual American football game that determines the champion of the National Football League (NFL). The game culminates a season that begins in the previous calendar year, and is the conclusion of the NFL playoffs. The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand,[1] usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums.[2] Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.




The Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL–NFL Championship Game (Super Bowl I)


Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests. The first two were known as the "AFL–NFL World Championship Game". Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the "Super Bowl" moniker, the names "Super Bowl I" and "Super Bowl II" were only retroactively applied to the first two games.[3] The NFC/NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 26, while the AFC/AFL has won 25. Nineteen different franchises, including teams that relocated to another city, have won the Super Bowl.[4]
The Pittsburgh Steelers (6–2) have won the most Super Bowls with six championships, while the New England Patriots (5-4), the Dallas Cowboys (5–3), and the San Francisco 49ers (5–1) have five wins. New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with nine, while the Buffalo Bills (0–4) have the most consecutive appearances with four losses in a row from 1990 to 1993. The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances: 1972–74. The Denver Broncos (3–5) have lost a record five Super Bowls. The New England Patriots (5–4), the Minnesota Vikings (0–4), and the Bills have lost four. The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises: the 1966–67 Green Bay Packers, the 1972–73 Miami Dolphins, the 1974–75 and 1978–79 Pittsburgh Steelers (the only team to accomplish this feat twice), the 1988–89 San Francisco 49ers, the 1992–93 Dallas Cowboys, the 1997–98 Denver Broncos, and the 2003–04 New England Patriots. Among those, Dallas (1992–93; 1995) and New England (2001; 2003–04) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls. The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII. The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens, who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position. Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl, including franchise relocations and renaming: the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Houston Texans, though both the Browns (1964) and Lions (1957) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl.

Pittsburgh Steelers (twice: IX and X as well as XIII and XIV)
San Francisco 49ers (XXIII and XXIV)
Dallas Cowboys (XXVII and XXVIII)

Teams with no Super Bowl appearances
Four current teams have never reached the Super Bowl. Two of them held NFL league championships prior to Super Bowl I in the 1966 NFL season:

Detroit Lions, NFL champions four times in 1935, 1952, 1953, and 1957; appeared in one other NFL Championship Game in 1954; and appeared in one NFC Championship Game in 1991[67]
Cleveland Browns, NFL champions four times in 1950, 1954, 1955, and 1964; appeared in seven other NFL championship games in 1951, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1965, 1968, and 1969; and appeared in three AFC Championship Games in 1986, 1987, and 1989.[68] The Browns are officially viewed as one continuous franchise that began in 1946 as a member of the All-America Football Conference, joined the NFL in 1950, suspended operations from 1996–1998, and resumed play in 1999.[69] The Baltimore Ravens were an expansion team created in 1996 with former Browns players.[70]
Jacksonville Jaguars, 1995 expansion team; appeared in two AFC Championship Games in 1996 and 1999[71]
Houston Texans, 2002 expansion team; Divisional Round appearances in 2011, 2012, and 2016 seasons.

In addition, Detroit, Houston and Jacksonville have hosted Super Bowls; this means Cleveland is the only current NFL city that has neither hosted, nor had its team play in, a Super Bowl.
Teams with Super Bowl appearances but no victories
Nine teams have appeared in the Super Bowl without ever winning. In descending order of number of appearances, they are:

Buffalo Bills (4), appeared in Super Bowls XXV, XXVI, XXVII, and XXVIII. Their second and last AFL championship was in 1965, the season before the first Super Bowl.
Minnesota Vikings (4), appeared in Super Bowls IV, VIII, IX, and XI. They won the NFL Championship Game in 1969, the last year before the AFL–NFL merger, but failed to win the subsequent Super Bowl. An NFL expansion team in 1961, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships.
Cincinnati Bengals (2), appeared in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. An AFL expansion team in 1968, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships.
Philadelphia Eagles (2), appeared in Super Bowls XV and XXXIX. Their last championship was in 1960.
Atlanta Falcons (2), appeared in Super Bowls XXXIII and LI. An expansion team in 1966, they have no pre-Super Bowl league championships.
Carolina Panthers (2), appeared in Super Bowls XXXVIII and 50. A post-merger expansion team, their first season was in 1995.
Arizona Cardinals (1), appeared in Super Bowl XLIII. Their last championship was in 1947 as the Chicago Cardinals.
Los Angeles Chargers (1), appeared in Super Bowl XXIX as the San Diego Chargers. Their only AFL championship was in 1963.
Tennessee Titans (1), appeared in Super Bowl XXXIV. They won the first two AFL Championships in 1960 and 1961 as the Houston Oilers.

Teams with long Super Bowl droughts




The Jets' victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III was the team's last championship appearance.


While Jacksonville (joined 1995) has never appeared in a Super Bowl, the following eight teams are currently (as of Super Bowl LI) experiencing longer droughts since their last appearance.
Two of these teams have not appeared in the Super Bowl since before the AFL–NFL merger in 1970:[72]

New York Jets (most recently appeared in Super Bowl III, 1968 season)
Kansas City Chiefs (Super Bowl IV in 1969 season)

The most recent Super Bowl appearance for the following teams was after the AFL–NFL merger, but prior to the 1995 regular season:

Minnesota Vikings (Super Bowl XI, 1976 season)
Miami Dolphins (Super Bowl XIX, 1984 season)
Cincinnati Bengals (Super Bowl XXIII, 1988 season)
Washington Redskins (Super Bowl XXVI, 1991 season)
Buffalo Bills (Super Bowl XXVIII, 1993 season)
San Diego Chargers (Super Bowl XXIX, 1994 season)

Super Bowl rematches
The following teams have faced each other more than once in the Super Bowl:

Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers (3) – Super Bowls X and XIII were won by Pittsburgh, and Super Bowl XXX was won by Dallas. See also Cowboys–Steelers rivalry.
Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins (2) – Super Bowl VII was won by Miami, and Super Bowl XVII was won by Washington.
Cincinnati Bengals and San Francisco 49ers (2) – Super Bowls XVI and XXIII were both won by San Francisco.
Buffalo Bills and Dallas Cowboys (2) – Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII, the only rematch in consecutive seasons, were both won by Dallas.
New England Patriots and New York Giants (2) – Super Bowls XLII and XLVI were both won by New York.

^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Inglewood are all located in the Greater Los Angeles Area.[5] Pontiac, Michigan, is a suburb of Detroit.[6] Both Tempe and Glendale are suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona.[7][8] Both Stanford and Santa Clara are part of the San Francisco Bay Area Combined Statistical Area.[9]
^ a b c d e f g h i j k The Miami Orange Bowl was in Miami proper. Hard Rock Stadium, also in Miami-Dade County, opened in an unincorporated area with a Miami address; the area was incorporated as Miami Gardens in 2003.
^ a b c d e f g h i j k Stadium renaming. Qualcomm Stadium was originally known as San Diego Stadium and San Diego–Jack Murphy Stadium. Hard Rock Stadium has also been variously known over the years as Joe Robbie Stadium, Pro Player Park, Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium (with a plural "s"), Dolphin Stadium (with no "s"), Land Shark Stadium, and Sun Life Stadium. NRG Stadium was originally known as Reliant Stadium.
^ a b c d e Dates are tentative, pending possible future changes to the NFL calendar.
^ a b c d The Colts, Steelers, and Browns moved from the NFL to the newly-formed AFC, joining the ten extant AFL franchises, when the two leagues merged in 1970. Additionally, although the 1995 Cleveland Browns became the 1996 Baltimore Ravens, the Browns' name, brand and history remained in Cleveland and was continued by the 1999 Cleveland Browns; the Ravens, for historical purposes, are considered a separate franchise.

1 – From 1966 to 1969, the first four Super Bowls were "World Championship" games played between two independent professional football leagues, AFL and NFL, and when the league merged in 1970 the Super Bowl became the NFL Championship Game.
2 – Dates in the list denote the season, not the calendar year in which the championship game was played. For instance, Super Bowl XLI was played in 2007, but was the championship for the 2006 season.
