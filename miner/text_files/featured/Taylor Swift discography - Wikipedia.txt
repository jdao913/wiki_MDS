American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's career began with a record deal with Big Machine Records in 2005 and the release of her eponymous debut album the following year. In the United States, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and stayed the longest on the chart during the 2000s.[1] All of its singles—"Tim McGraw", "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn", and "Should've Said No"—charted within the top forty in the United States and were certified platinum by the RIAA.[2][3] Swift followed with the release of the EPs Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection and Beautiful Eyes, which peaked at number twenty and number nine on the Billboard 200, respectively.[4]
Swift released her second studio album, Fearless, in 2008, which topped the charts in the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. It became the best-selling album of 2009 in the United States,[5] and thirteen of its songs charted within the top forty of the Billboard Hot 100, breaking the record for the most top forty entries from a single album.[6] Its songs "Love Story", "You Belong with Me", and "Fearless" reached the top ten in the United States while "Love Story" became her first number-one single in Australia. She obtained her first number-one single in Canada with "Today Was a Fairytale" from the Valentine's Day soundtrack (2010).[7] Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), peaked at number-one in the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Three of its singles—"Mine", "Back to December", and "Mean"—peaked within the top ten in Canada.[3]
Swift's fourth studio album, Red (2012), became her first number one album in the United Kingdom, and also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and United States. It spawned the internationally successful singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble", with the former reaching number-one in Canada, New Zealand, and the United States.[8] Swift's fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), debuted atop the Billboard 200 with sales of 1.287 million copies, making her the first artist to release three albums (after Speak Now and Red) with sales of one million within a single week.[9] The album reached number-one in several other countries, including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom; as of 2016, it has sold a total of 10.1 million copies worldwide. The singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood" all reached number one in the United States, Australia, and Canada.[10] A track she recorded with Zayn titled "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" for the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack reached number one in Sweden and number two in the US. Her sixth album Reputation (2017) and its lead single "Look What You Made Me Do" reached number one in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
According to RIAA, Swift is the second-best-selling digital singles artist in the United States, with cumulative single certifications of 102 million digital downloads and on-demand streaming.[11] Meanwhile, US total album sales stand at 29.92 million copies.[12] With estimated sales of over 42 million albums and 130 million singles worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling music artists.[13]
