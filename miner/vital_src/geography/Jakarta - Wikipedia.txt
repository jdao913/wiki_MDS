Jakarta (/dʒəˈkɑːrtə/, Indonesian pronunciation: [dʒaˈkarta]), officially the Special Capital Region of Jakarta, is the capital of Indonesia, formerly Batavia during Dutch East Indies and Sunda Kelapa during Sunda Kingdom. Located on the northwest coast of the world's most populous island of Java, Jakarta is the center of economics, culture and politics of Indonesia, with a population of 10,075,310 as of 2014[update].[8][9] Greater Jakarta metropolitan area, which is known as Jabodetabek (a name formed by combining the initial syllables of Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi), is the second largest urban agglomeration and 2nd largest city area in the world after Tokyo, with a population of 30,214,303 inhabitants as of 2010[update] census.[10] Jakarta's business opportunities, as well as its potential to offer a higher standard of living, attract migrants from all over the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of many communities and cultures.[11] Jakarta is officially a province with special capital region status, yet is commonly referred to as a city. The Jakarta provincial government administers five administrative cities and one administrative regency.
Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Kingdom of Sunda. It was the de facto capital of the Dutch East Indies, which was known as Batavia at that time. The city is currently the seat of the ASEAN Secretariat as well as important financial institutions such as the Bank of Indonesia, the Indonesia Stock Exchange, and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations. As of 2017, six of Forbes Global 2000 companies have headquarters in the city.[12] The city is also home for two Fortune 500 companies in 2016.[13]
Jakarta is listed as an Alpha Global City in the 2016 report of Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).[14] Based on the global metro monitor by the Brookings Institution, in 2014, the GDP of Jakarta was estimated at US$321.3 billion[15] and economic growth was ranked 34th among the world's 200 largest cities.[16] Jakarta has grown more rapidly than Kuala Lumpur, Beijing, and Bangkok.[17]

Names and etymology[edit]




Replica of the Padrão of Sunda Kalapa (1522), a stone pillar commemorating a treaty between Portuguese Kingdom and Hindu Sunda Kingdom, at Jakarta History Museum.


Jakarta has been home to multiple settlements along with their respective names:

Sunda Kelapa (397–1527),
Jayakarta (1527–1619),
Batavia (1619–1949),
Djakarta (1949–1972), and
Jakarta (1972–present).

Its current name derives from the word Jayakarta. The origins of this word can be traced to the Old Javanese and ultimately to the Sanskrit language; जय jaya (victorious)[18] and कृत krta (accomplished, acquired),[19] thus "Jayakarta" translates as "victorious deed", "complete act", or "complete victory".
Jakarta is nicknamed the Big Durian, the thorny strongly-odored fruit native to the region,[1] as the city is seen as the Indonesian equivalent of the US city of New York (the Big Apple).[20] In the colonial era, the city was also known as Koningin van het Oosten (Queen of the Orient), initially in the 17th century for the urban beauty of downtown Batavia's canals, mansions and ordered city layout.[21] After expanding to the south in the 19th century, this nickname came to be more associated with the suburbs (e.g. Menteng and the area around Merdeka Square), with their wide lanes, many green spaces and villas.[22]
Pre-colonial era[edit]
Further information: Sunda Kelapa




The 5th century Tugu inscription discovered in Tugu district, North Jakarta


The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the fourth century Sundanese kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia.[23] Following the decline of Tarumanagara, its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda. From 7th to early 13th century port of Sunda was within the sphere of influence of the Srivijaya maritime empire. According to the Chinese source, Chu-fan-chi, written circa 1225, Chou Ju-kua reported in the early 13th century Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula and western Java (Sunda). The source reports the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, pepper from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden piles.[24] The harbour area became known as Sunda Kelapa (Sundanese: ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮊᮜᮕ) and by the fourteenth century, it was a major trading port for the Sunda kingdom.
The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 when the Portuguese were looking for a route for spices.[25] The Hindu Kingdom of Sunda made an alliance treaty with Portugal by allowing the Portuguese to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of the Islamic Sultanate of Demak from central Java.[26] In 1527, Fatahillah, a Javanese general from Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta,[26] and became a fiefdom of the Sultanate of Banten which became a major Southeast Asia trading centre.
Through the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta from the Sultanate of Banten, Dutch ships arrived in Jayakarta in 1596. In 1602, the English East India Company's first voyage, commanded by Sir James Lancaster, arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the centre of English trade in Indonesia until 1682.[27]
Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the English merchants, rivals of the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.[28]
Colonial era[edit]

Dutch Batavia built in what is now Jakarta, by Andries Beeckman c. 1656


When relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, Jayawikarta's soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. Prince Jayawikarta's army and the English were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen (J.P. Coen). The Dutch burned the English fort, and forced the English to retreat on their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power and in 1619 they renamed the city Batavia.
Commercial opportunities in the capital of the Dutch colony attracted Indonesian and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740 and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls.[29] At the beginning of the nineteenth century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number which changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded, fabrics, especially imported cotton, batik and clothing worn by Arab communities.[30]




The City Hall of Batavia (Stadhuis van Batavia), the seat of the Governor General of the VOC in the late 18th century by Johannes Rach c. 1770. The building now houses the Jakarta History Museum, Jakarta Old Town.


The city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 caused more people to move away from the port. The Koningsplein, now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in 1913,[31] and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area.[29] By 1930 Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants,[32] including 37,067 Europeans.[33]
After World War II, the city of Batavia was renamed "Jakarta" (a short form of Jayakarta) by the Indonesian nationalists after achieving independence from the Dutch in 1949.[34]
Independence era[edit]




Monas which stands in the centre of Merdeka square, commemorates the Indonesian struggle for independence.


Following World War II, Indonesian Republicans withdrew from Allied-occupied Jakarta during their fight for Indonesian independence and established their capital in Yogyakarta. In 1950, once independence was secured, Jakarta was once again made the national capital.[29] Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno, envisaged Jakarta as a great international city, and instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic and modernist architecture.[35][36] Projects included a clover-leaf highway, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, Hotel Indonesia, a shopping centre, and a new parliament building. In October 1965, Jakarta was the site of an abortive coup attempt in which 6 top generals were killed, precipitating a violent anti-communist purge in which half-a million people were killed, including many ethnic Chinese,[37] and the beginning of Suharto's New Order. A monument stands where the generals' bodies were dumped.




Jalan Jenderal Sudirman, Jakarta's main avenue and business district


In 1966, Jakarta was declared a "special capital region" (daerah khusus ibukota), thus gaining a status approximately equivalent to that of a province.[38] Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as Governor from the mid-1960s commencement of the "New Order" through to 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, built several hospitals, and a large number of new schools. He also cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects—some for the benefit of the Suharto family[39][40]—and tried to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty.[41] Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom which changed the face of the city.[42]
The boom ended with the 1997/98 East Asian Economic crisis putting Jakarta at the centre of violence, protest, and political manoeuvring. After 32 years in power, support for President Suharto began to wane. Tensions reached a peak when four students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces; four days of riots and violence ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings.[43] Much of the rioting targeted Chinese Indonesians.[44] Suharto resigned as president, and Jakarta has remained the focal point of democratic change in Indonesia.[45] Jemaah Islamiah-connected bombings occurred almost annually in the city between 2000 and 2005,[29] with another bombing in 2009.[46]
Administration[edit]

Government[edit]




Governor's office at Jakarta City Hall Complex


The name and status, as well as the governing system of Jakarta, has changed throughout its history. On March 5, 1942, the Japanese wrested Batavia from Dutch control and the city was named Jakarta (Jakarta Special City (ジャカルタ特別市, Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi), in accordance with the special status that was assigned to the city). After the collapse of Japan, Indonesian nationalists declared independence on August 17, 1945, [47] and the government of Jakarta City was changed into the Jakarta National Administration in September, 1945. After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognized until full Indonesian independence was achieved on December 27, 1949 and Jakarta was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.
This first government was led by a Mayor until the end of 1960, when the office was changed to that of a Governor. The last mayor of Jakarta was Sudiro, until he was replaced by Dr Sumarno as governor of the province. Based on Act No. 5 of 1974 relating to the Fundamentals of Regional Government, Jakarta was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of Indonesia's 26 provinces in 1974 at that time.[48] In August 2007, Jakarta held its first ever election to choose a governor, whereas previously the city's governors were elected by members of DPRD. The poll was part of a country-wide decentralisation drive, allowing for direct local elections in several areas.[49]
At present, Jakarta is administratively equal to a province with special status as the capital of Indonesia. The executive heads of Jakarta are a Governor (instead of a mayor) and a Deputy Governor. As a province, the official name of Jakarta is Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta ('Special Capital City District of Jakarta'), which is abbreviated to DKI Jakarta. The legislative branch of Jakarta is the People's regional representative council (DPRD). The Governor, Deputy Governor and 106 members of the DPRD, are all elected by direct election procedures.
The executive governance of Jakarta consists of five Administrative City/Kota Administratif, each headed by a Mayor – and one Administrative Regency/Kabupaten Administratif headed by a Regent/Bupati. Unlike other cities and regencies in Indonesia where the mayor or regent are elected by the people, Jakarta's mayors and regent are chosen by the Governor of Jakarta. Each city and regency is again divided into administrative districts.
Polda Metro Jaya maintains the law, security and order of Jakarta. It is led by a Regional Chief of police Kapolda, who holds the rank of Inspector General of Police.
Municipal finances[edit]
The Jakarta provincial government, like all other provincial governments in Indonesia, relies on transfers from the central government for the bulk of budget income. Local (non-central government) sources of revenue are incomes from various taxes such as vehicle ownership and vehicle transfer fees among others.[50] The ability of the regional government to respond to the many problems of Jakarta is constrained by extremely limited finances. In 2013 the total budget available to the Jakarta regional government was approved at around Rp 50 trillion (about $US 5.2 billion), equivalent to around $US 380 per citizen. Priority areas of spending were listed as education, transport, flood control measures, environment programs, and various types of social spending (such as health and housing).[51]
In recent years, the Jakarta provincial government has consistently run a surplus of between 15–20% of total planned spending, largely because of delays in procurement procedures and other inefficiencies in the spending process.[52] Regular underspending is a matter of frequent public comment but the legal and administrative blockages that cause the underspending problem seem very difficult to overcome.[53]

Administrative divisions of Jakarta[edit]




Map of the municipalities (Kota administrasi) in Jakarta province. Each city is divided into districts (Kecamatan).


Jakarta consists of five Kota Administratif (Administrative cities/municipalities), each headed by a mayor – and a Kabupaten Administratif (Administrative regency). Each city and regency is again divided into districts/Kecamatan. The administrative cities/municipalities of Jakarta are:

Central Jakarta (Jakarta Pusat) is Jakarta's smallest city and home to most of Jakarta's administrative and political centre. It is divided into 8 administrative districts. It is characterised by large parks and Dutch colonial buildings. Landmarks include the National Monument (Monas), Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta, Jakarta Cathedral, and museums.[55]
West Jakarta (Jakarta Barat) has the highest concentration of small-scale industries in Jakarta. This city has 8 districts. The area includes Jakarta's Chinatown and Dutch colonial landmarks such as the Chinese Langgam building and Toko Merah. West Jakarta contains part of Jakarta Old Town.[56]
South Jakarta (Jakarta Selatan), originally planned as a satellite city, is now the location of large upscale shopping centres and affluent residential areas. South Jakarta is again divided into 10 territorial districts. Jakarta Selatan functions as Jakarta's ground water buffer,[57] but recently the green belt areas are threatened by new developments. Much of the CBD area of Jakarta is concentrated in Setiabudi, South Jakarta, bordering the Tanah Abang/Sudirman area of Central Jakarta.
East Jakarta (Jakarta Timur) territory is characterised by several industrial sectors.[58] Also located in East Jakarta are Taman Mini Indonesia Indah and Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport. This city has 10 districts/kecamatan.
North Jakarta (Jakarta Utara) is the only city in Jakarta that is bounded by the sea (Java Sea). It is the location of the Tanjung Priok. Large-scale and medium-scale industries are concentrated in North Jakarta. North Jakarta contains part of Jakarta Old Town, formerly known as Batavia since the 17th century, and was the centre of VOC trade activity in Dutch East Indies. Also located in North Jakarta is Ancol Dreamland (Taman Impian Jaya Ancol), currently the largest integrated tourism area in South East Asia.[59] North Jakarta is divided into 6 districts.

The only administrative regency (kabupaten) of Jakarta is:

Thousand Islands (Kepulauan Seribu), formerly a district within the city of North Jakarta, is a collection of 105 small islands located on the Java Sea. It has of high conservation value because of its unique and special ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, water bicycling, and wind surfing, are the primary touristic activities in this territory. The main mode of transportation between the islands are speed boats or small ferries.[60]

Geography[edit]
DKI Jakarta covers an area of 661.5 square kilometers, which is ranked 33rd among the provinces of Indonesia. Greater Jakarta metropolitan area has an area of 6,392 square kilometers, which extends into two of the bordering provinces of West Java and Banten.[62] The Greater Jakarta area includes 3 bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang Regency and Bogor Regency) and five adjacent cities (Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang).
Topography[edit]

Ancol beach


Jakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, which is an inlet of the Java Sea. The northern part of Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (the other is Dili, capital of Timor Leste). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is 662 km2 (256 sq mi) of land area and 6,977 km2 (2,694 sq mi) of sea area.[63] The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.
Jakarta lies in a low and flat Alluvial plain, ranging from −2 to 50 metres (−7 to 164 ft) with an average elevation of 8 metres (26 ft) above sea level with historically extensive swampy areas. 40% of Jakarta, particularly the northern areas, is below sea level,[64] while the southern parts are comparatively hilly. Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They are:[65] Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke River, Maja,[66] Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River. These rivers flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western and eastern districts.
All these rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding. Moreover, Jakarta is sinking about 5 to 10 centimetres (2.0 to 3.9 inches) each year, even up to 20 centimetres (7.9 inches) in the northern coastal areas. To help cope with the threat from the sea, the Netherlands will give $4 million for a feasibility study to build a dike around Jakarta Bay. The ring dike will be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater. Additionally, the dike will function as a toll road. The project will be built by 2025.[67] In January 2014, Central Government agreed to build 2 dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a 1.2-kilometre (0.75-mile) tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease Jakarta floods. Construction costs will be paid for by the central government, but land acquisitions are the responsibility of the Jakarta Authority.[68] Nowadays, an 1.2-kilometre (0.75-mile), with capacity 60 cubic metres (2,100 cubic feet) per second, underground water tunnel between Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows.[69]
Climate[edit]
Jakarta has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) according to the Köppen climate classification system. The wet season in Jakarta covers the majority of the year, running from October through May. The remaining four months (June through September) constitute the city's drier season (each of these 4 months has an average monthly rainfall of less than 100 millimetres (3.9 in)). Located in the western part of Java, Jakarta's wet season rainfall peak is January and February with average monthly rainfall of 299.7 millimetres (11.80 in), and its dry season low point is August with a monthly average of 43.2 mm (1.70 in).

In June 2011, Jakarta had only 10.5% green open spaces (Ruang Terbuka Hijau) and this has grown to 13.94% public green open spaces. Public parks are included in public green open spaces. By 2030, the administration also hope there is 16% private green open spaces.[72] In a goal to develop a child friendly city and to provide green open spaces for citizens, Jakarta administration has targeted to build 300 Child Friendly Integrated Public Space (Indonesian: Ruang Publik Terpadu Ramah Anak, abbreviated RPTRA) by 2017, which is a public space in the form of green open spaces or parks equipped with playground, games, library, lactation room, and other facilities to serve the interests of communities around with CCTV surveillance.[73].[74]

Merdeka Square (Medan Merdeka) is an almost 1 km2 field housing the symbol of Jakarta, Monas or Monumen Nasional (National Monument) and is the largest city square in the world. The square was created by Dutch Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels (1810) and was originally named Koningsplein (King's Square). On 10 January 1993, President Soeharto started the beautification of the square. Several features including a deer park and 33 trees that represent the 33 provinces of Indonesia were added.[75]
Lapangan Banteng (Buffalo Field) is located in Central Jakarta near Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta, Jakarta Cathedral, and Jakarta Central Post Office. It is about 4.5 hectares. Initially it was called Waterlooplein and functioned as the ceremonial square during the Netherlands East Indies colonial period. A number of colonial monuments and memorials erected on the square during the colonial period were demolished during the Sukarno era. The most notable monument in the square is the Monumen Pembebasan Irian Barat (Monument of the Liberation of West Irian). During the 1970s and 1980s the park was used as a bus terminal. In 1993 the park was turned into a public space again. It has become a recreation place for people and is occasionally also used as an exhibition place or for other events.[76] 'Jakarta Flona' (Flora dan Fauna), a flower and decoration plants and pet exhibition, is held in this park around August annually.

* 2010 Population census



Since 1950, Jakarta has attracted people from all parts of Java and other Indonesian islands. The flood of migrants came to Jakarta for economic reasons as Jakarta offered the hope of employment. The 1961 census showed only 51% of the city's population was actually born in Jakarta.[83] Between 1961 and 1980, the population of Jakarta doubled and during the period 1980–1990, the city's population grew annually by 3.7%.[84]
The 2010 census counted some 9.58 million people, well above all government estimates.[85] According to the government's 'Jakarta in Figures' document, the population stood at 10,187,595 in 2011 and 9,761,407 in 2012.[86] As per 2014, the population stood at 10,075,310 people.[8] The area of DKI Jakarta is 664 km2, suggesting a population density of 15,174 people/km2.[87] Inwards immigration tended to negate the effect of family planning programs.[48] The population has risen from 4.5 million in 1970 doubled to 9.5 million in 2010, counting only its legal residents.[citation needed] While the population of Greater Jakarta (Jabodetabek Region) has risen from 8.2 million in 1970 jumping to 28.5 million in 2010.[88] As per 2014, the population of Greater Jakarta was 30,326,103, accounting for 11% of Indonesia's overall population.[89] The gender ratio was 102.8 (males per 100 females) in 2010[90] and 101.3 in 2014.[8]

Jakarta is a pluralistic and religiously diverse city. As of 2000, 35.16% of the city's population are Javanese, 27.65% Betawi, 15.27% Sundanese, 5.53% Chinese, 3.61% Batak, 3.18% Minangkabau and 1.62% Malays.
The 'Betawi' (Orang Betawi, or 'people of Batavia') are the descendants of the people living in and around Batavia, and are recognised as an ethnic group from around the 18th–19th century. The Betawi people are mostly descended from various Southeast-Asian ethnic groups brought or attracted to Batavia to meet labour needs, and include people from different parts of Indonesia.[92] Betawi people are a creole ethnic group that came from various parts of Indonesia and intermarried with Chinese, Arabs, and Europeans.[93] Nowadays, most Betawi live in the fringe areas of Jakarta and there are hardly any Betawi-dominated areas in central Jakarta.[94]
There has been a significant Chinese community in Jakarta for many centuries. Jakarta is home to the largest population of Chinese on Java island. The Chinese in Jakarta traditionally reside around old urban areas, such as Pinangsia, Pluit and Glodok (Jakarta Chinatown) areas. They also can be found in the old chinatowns of Senen and Jatinegara. Officially, they make up 5.53% of the Jakarta population, although this number may be under-reported.[95]
The Sumatran people of the city are very diverse. According to 2010 Census, there were roughly 346,000 Batak, 305,000 Minangkabau and 155,000 Malays. The Batak and Minangkabau are spread throughout the city. The Batak ethnic group has increased in ranking, from eighth in 1930 to fifth in 2000. Toba Batak is the largest sub-ethnic Batak group in Jakarta.[96] Beside the Chinese, Minangkabau people also as merchants, peddlers, and artisans, in addition to working in white collar professions: doctors, teachers, and journalists.[97][98]
Bahasa Indonesia is the official as well as the spoken language of Jakarta. English is used widely as second language, while a number of elderly people can speak Dutch. Each of the ethnic groups use their mother language at home, such as Betawi language, Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, Batak, Minangkabau, and Chinese. Betawi language is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming itself as a language island in the surrounding area. The language is mostly based on the East Malay dialect and enriched by loan words from Dutch, Portuguese, Sundanese, Javanese, Minangkabau, Chinese, and Arabic. Nowadays, the Jakarta dialect (Bahasa Jakarta), used as a street language by people in Jakarta, is loosely based on the Betawi language.
Religion[edit]

Most pesantrens in Jakarta are affiliated with the traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama organisations.[100] The modernist organisations mostly catered to a socioeconomic class of educated urban elites and merchant traders. They gave priority to education, social welfare programs and religious propagation activities.[101] Many Islamic organisations have headquarters in Jakarta, such as Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesian Ulema Council, Muhammadiyah, Jaringan Islam Liberal, and Front Pembela Islam.
Roman Catholics have a Metropolitan see there, for the Archdiocese of Jakarta, whose province including two suffragans Western Java.
Culture[edit]
As the economic and political capital of Indonesia with so many different languages and ethnic groups, it is difficult to describe or define a common culture for Jakarta, as the city attracts many native immigrants, from the vast and diverse Indonesian archipelago, who also bring their various languages, dialects, foods and customs. This diversity of origins and languages leads to differences in regard to religion, traditions and linguistics. However ethnic Betawi are considered as the indigenous people of Jakarta.
Arts and festivals[edit]




Ondel-Ondel, often used as a symbol of Betawi culture


The Betawi culture is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming itself as a language island in the surrounding area. Betawi arts have a low profile in Jakarta, and most Betawi have moved to the suburbs of Jakarta, displaced by new migrants. It is easier to find Java or Minang-based wedding ceremonies rather than Betawi weddings in Jakarta. It is easier to find Javanese Gamelan instead of Tanjidor (a mixture between Betawi and Portuguese music), Marawis (a mixture between Betawi and Yemeni music) or Gambang Kromong (a mixture between Betawi and Chinese music). The Chinese also influenced Betawi culture, such as the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, firecrackers, to Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.
However, some festivals such as the Jalan Jaksa Festival or Kemang Festival include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to give performances.[102] Jakarta has several performing art centres, such as the classical concert hall Aula Simfonia Jakarta in Kemayoran, Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) art centre in Cikini, Gedung Kesenian Jakarta near Pasar Baru, Balai Sarbini in the Plaza Semanggi area, Bentara Budaya Jakarta in Palmerah area, Pasar Seni (Art Market) in Ancol, and traditional Indonesian art performances at the pavilions of some provinces in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. Traditional music is often found at high-class hotels, including Wayang and Gamelan performances. Javanese Wayang Orang performances can be found at Wayang Orang Bharata theatre near Senen bus terminal. As the country's largest city and capital, Jakarta has lured much national and regional talent who hope to find a greater audience and more opportunities for success.
Jakarta hosts several prestigious art and culture festivals, and exhibitions, such as the annual Jakarta International Film Festival (JiFFest), Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival, Jakarta Fashion Week, Jakarta Fashion & Food Festival (JFFF), Jakarta Fair, Indonesia Creative Products and Jakarta Arts and Crafts exhibition. Flona Jakarta is a flora-and-fauna exhibition, held annually in August at Lapangan Banteng Park, featuring flowers, plant nurseries, and pets. Jakarta Fair is held annually from mid-June to mid-July to celebrate the anniversary of the city and is largely centred around a trade fair. However, this month-long fair also features entertainment, including arts and music performances by local musicians.Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival (JJF) is one of the largest jazz festivals in the world and arguably the biggest in the Southern hemisphere. The annual jazz festival is held every early March and was designed to be one of the largest jazz festivals globally.
Several foreign art and culture centres are also established in Jakarta, and mainly serve to promote culture and language through learning centers, libraries, and art galleries. Among these foreign art and cultural centers are China Confucius Institute, Netherlands Erasmus Huis, UK British Council, France Alliance Française, Germany Goethe-Institut, Japan Foundation, and India Jawaharlal Nehru Indian Cultural Center.

Other popular Betawi dishes include soto kaki, nasi uduk, kerak telor (spicy omelette), nasi ulam, asinan, ketoprak, rujak and gado-gado Betawi (salad in peanut sauce).
Jakarta has a vast range of food available at hundreds of eating venues and food courts located all over the city, from modest street-side warung foodstalls and kaki lima (five legs) travelling vendors to high-end fine dining restaurants. Since Jakarta is regarded as the 'melting-pot' and a miniature version of Indonesia, many traditional foods from far-flung regions in Indonesia can be found in Jakarta. For example, traditional Padang restaurants and low-budget Warteg (Warung Tegal) foodstalls are ubiquitous in the capital. Other popular street foods include nasi goreng (fried rice), sate (skewered meats), pecel lele (fried catfish), bakso (meatballs), bakpau (Chinese bun) and siomay (fish dumplings).

Infrastructure[edit]
Road[edit]

Part of Jakarta Inner Ring Road or Jalan Tol Lingkar Dalam Jakarta in Grogol Petamburan, West Jakarta


A structured road network had been developed in the early 19th century as a part of the Java Great Post Road by former Governor-General Daendels, which connects most major cities throughout Java. During the following decades, the road network was expanded to a great extent, although it could not keep up with the rapidly increasing numbers of motorised vehicles, resulting in highly congested traffic.
A notable feature of Jakarta's present road system is the toll road network. Composed of an inner and outer ring road and five toll roads radiating outwards, the network provides inner as well as outer city connections. Jakarta Outer Ring Road 2 is a planned toll road circling the area of Jakarta greater area, parallel with Jakarta Outer Ring Road (JORR 1). Six elevated toll roads are in tender progress. The five radiating toll roads are:

Prof. Dr. Sedyatmo Toll Road linking to Soekarno–Hatta International Airport
Jakarta–Tangerang Toll Road linking to Tangerang and further to Merak in the west
Jakarta–Serpong Toll Road linking to Serpong
Jagorawi Toll Road linking to Bogor and Ciawi in the south
Jakarta–Cikampek Toll Road linking to Bekasi and Cikampek in the east

Throughout the years, several attempts have been made to reduce traffic congestion on Jakarta's main arteries. Implemented solutions include a 'three-in-one' rush-hour law, during which cars with fewer than three passengers are prohibited from driving on the main avenues. Another example is the ban on trucks passing main avenues during the day.[138] In 2016, 'odd-even' policy was introduced which designated cars with either odd or even-numbered registration plates on a particular day.[139] This aims to function as a transitional measure to alleviate traffic congestion until the future introduction of Electronic Road Pricing which would be more effective.[140]
Water supply[edit]
For more details on this topic, see Water privatisation in Jakarta.
Two private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide piped water supply in the western and eastern half of Jakarta respectively under 25-year concession contracts signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. 80% of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River 70 km (43 mi) southeast of the city. Water supply had been privatised by government of then President Suharto in 1998 to the French company Suez Environnement and the British company Thames Water International. Both foreign companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the 7 first years of the concessions had been lower than before, despite substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005 tariffs were frozen, leading the private water companies to cut down on investments.
According to PALYJA in its western half of the concession the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% in 1998 to 59% in 2007 and 65% in 2010.[141] According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in the eastern half of the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004, but stagnated after that.[142] However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: One study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005,[143] while another source estimates it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011.[144] Those without access to piped water supply get water mostly from wells that are often salty and polluted with bacteria. As of 2017, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta has a crisis of clean water.[145]

Transportation[edit]
With 30 million people in the metropolitan area, nearly 10 million vehicles in daily use, and limited rapid transit system[146] Jakarta is strained by transportation problems.[147] The city suffers a lack of urban public transport services due to prioritised development of road networks, which were mostly designed to accommodate private vehicles.[148] In 2004, a study was undertaken to prepare a master-plan for an integrated public transport system within Greater Jakarta, which revealed the mode as follows,[149]

Road transport[edit]
Electronic road pricing[edit]
Due to the city's acute gridlock, the Jakarta administration has decided to implement electronic toll collection in 10 districts: Tanah Abang, Menteng, Setiabudi, Tebet, Matraman, Senen, Gambir, Tambora, Sawah Besar and Taman Sari.[151] The ERP was planned to be implemented in the three-in-one zone and along Jl. Rasuna Said in Kuningan by the first quarter of 2014, although by September 2016 the plan has not started. Vehicles passing through the ERP areas will be charged Rp 21,072.[152]
Bus service[edit]
There are many bus terminals in the city, from where buses operate on numerous routes to connect neighborhoods within the city limit, to other areas of Greater Jakarta area and to cities across the island of Java. The biggest of the bus terminal is Pulo Gebang Bus Terminal, which is arguably the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia.[153] Besides TransJakarta, other private owned bus systems like Kopaja, MetroMini, Mayasari Bakti and APTB also provide important services for Jakarta commuters with numerous routes throughout the city. Since January 2013, Jakarta Government has integrated Kopaja AC buses with TransJakarta feeder bus routes. For the future, Metromini AC bus it is also possible to enter TransJakarta bus lanes to enhance integrated bus rapid transit system.
Traditional transports[edit]
In 1966, an estimated 160 thousand pedicabs (becak) operated in the city; as much as 15% of Jakarta's total workforce was engaged in becak driving. In 1971, becak were banned from major roads, and shortly thereafter the government attempted a total ban, which substantially reduced their numbers but did not eliminate them. A campaign to eliminate them succeeded in 1990 and 1991, but during the economic crisis of 1998, some returned amid less effective government attempts to control them.[154] Bajaj auto rikshaw provide local transportation in the back streets of some parts of the city. From the early 1940s to 1991 they were a common form of local transportation in the city. Angkot microbuses also play a major role in road transport of Jakarta. They operates in numerous routes to connect neighbourhoods of the city.
Taxi Cabs[edit]

Plenty of taxi cabs are available in the city. Many companies operate & maintain pools of different model of cars in own their brands. App-based taxi services also have wide presence.
Motorcycle taxi/ojek[edit]
Although ojeks are not an official form of public transport, they can be found throughout Indonesia and in Jakarta. They are especially useful when navigating crowded urban roads, narrow alleyways, heavy traffic and cramped locations that larger vehicles cannot reach.
City tour[edit]




Jakarta double-decker city tour bus passing through Jakarta landmarks and points of interest


Since February 2014, the Jakarta Government provides free double-decker bus tours that offers sightseeing in Central Jakarta. The tourists can catch the double-decker bus — free of charge, in several designated bus stops in front of city's points of interest. The buses' route covers tourist attractions, such as Monas, Istiqlal Mosque, the Cathedral, National Museum, Sarinah, and Plaza Indonesia, as well as Grand Indonesia shopping centres.[155][156] As 2016, there are 18 double-decker buses in Jakarta, and the service is expanded to include Kota Tua in the north and Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Senayan area in the south, via Sudirman avenue.[157]
Rail[edit]
Long-distance railways and local tram services were first introduced during the Dutch colonial era. While the trams were replaced with buses in the post-colonial era, long-distance railways continued to connect the city to its neighbouring regions as well as cities throughout the island of Java. Main terminus for long distance train services are Gambir and Pasar Senen. A commuter rail system KRL Jabodetabek connects areas within Greater Jakarta. Major rail stations of commter line are Jakarta Kota, Jatinegara, Tanah Abang, Duri, Pasar Senen, Manggarai and Sudirman. High-speed railways are planned connecting Jakarta-Bandung and Jakarta-Surabaya.
High speed rail[edit]
Further information: High-speed rail in Indonesia
The first high-speed rail to connect Jakarta with Bandung is currently under construction which is expected to start operation in 2019. The contract was awarded to China. Both Japan and China contested as a potential contractor, but it was awarded to China mainly because of their proposal did not require Indonesian fiscal spending or government debt guarantees.[158] The project cost was estimated to be US$5.5 billion. China Development Bank will fund 75 percent of the project. A joint venture company PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia-China has formed by China Railway Group Limited (CREC) with a consortium of Indonesia's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) led by PT Wijaya Karya Tbk to develop the project.[159]
Another project to upgrade of existing Jakarta-Surabaya route to high speed rail is undertaken in 2016. Priority was given to Japan this time who had been one of the biggest investors to Indonesia. The route is supposed to finish construction in 2019.[160]
Rapid transit[edit]
At present rapid transit in Greater Jakarta consists of a BRT TransJakarta and a commuter rail KRL Jabodetabek. Other transit systems, those are now being under construction are Jakarta MRT, Jakarta LRT and Soekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link, which are expected to be operational by 2018.
Bus rapid transit[edit]
Further information: TransJakarta




TransJakarta has the world's longest bus rapid transit routes.


The TransJakarta bus rapid transit service (known as Busway) was developed in the context of development reforms (or reformasi) and used Bogota's TransMilenio system as a model.[161] Jakarta's first busway line, from Blok M to Jakarta Kota opened in January 2004 and as of 14 February 2013, twelve out of fifteen corridors are in use. TransJakarta has the world's longest bus rapid transit routes (210 kilometres (130 miles) in length). So far TransJakarta serves total 80 routes (corridor, cross route & feeder route) at the end of 2016.[162] Transjakarta owned more than 1,500 buses in the first three months of 2017 and targets to have 3,000 buses by the end of the year.[163]
Commuter rail[edit]
Further information: KRL Jabodetabek




A KRL Jabotabek commuter train


KRL Jabodetabek or commonly known as Commuterline is a commuter rail system which serves commuters in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi. The commuter system was started in 2000.[164] The number of passengers in 2014 reached 208 million, rising from 158 million in the previous year.[165] About 280 million commuters used KRL Jabodetabek in the year of 2016.[166] KRL Jabotabek serves all municipalities in Jakarta excluding the Thousand Islands, as well as Greater Jakarta region. Though during rush hours, the number of passengers greatly exceeds the system's capacity, and crowding is common. Currently KRL Jabotabek is the only rail-based transit system in Jakarta, as the mass rapid transit and light rail transit are still under construction.
Jakarta MRT[edit]
Further information: Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit




Jakarta MRT construction in Jalan M.H. Thamrin, in 2016.


After a long planning process by the government regarding the development of a mass rapid transit system in Indonesia's capital, the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit infrastructure is currently under construction, with a north–south line between Kota and Lebak Bulus; and an east–west line, which will connect to the north–south line at Sawah Besar station. The Jakarta MRT will be a combination of subways and elevated rails. Preparation work started in April 2012,[167] and groundbreaking was done in October 2013, with the first, 15.2 km-long line between Hotel Indonesia and Lebak Bulus scheduled to be operational by 2018, and the north–south line MRT network is scheduled to be operational by 2020. The total length of the network when complete will be approximately 110.8 kilometres (68.8 miles).[168][169] The Jakarta city government decided on a rail-based system because of its ability to carry large numbers of people quickly and cheaply.[170] As of 2016[update], the mass rapid transit system has an investment of nearly US $1.7 billion to ease the capital's traffic issue in the coming years, including the construction of a subway.[171]
Jakarta LRT[edit]
Further information: Jakarta Light Rail Transit
Previously there had been plans to build a monorail system and part of it was already under construction, but the project stalled in 2004 due to lack of funding. The monorail project was relaunched in 2013 and the groundbreaking was done in October 2013.[172] However the project cancelled in January 2015, due to disagreements between the Jakarta administration and PT Jakarta Monorail over the monorail's route.[173] By mid 2015, this project is finally abandoned by Jakarta Government and being replaced by light rail transit system.
The light rail transit (LRT) project was launched to replace the previously abandoned monorail project.[174] Jakarta Light Rail Transit groundbreaking ceremony was held on 9 September 2015, with the first phase of the construction will connect Cibubur in East Jakarta with Dukuh Atas in downtown Central Jakarta, passing through Cawang intersection. This phase will be 42.1 kilometres (26.2 miles) long, which include 18 stations, and expected to be operated by the first half of 2018, prior to the 2018 Asian Games.[175]
Air[edit]




Soekarno–Hatta International Airport Terminal 3


Soekarno–Hatta International Airport (CGK) is the main airport serving the Greater Jakarta area. The airport is named after the first President of Indonesia, Soekarno, and the first vice-president, Mohammad Hatta. The airport is often called Cengkareng airport or Soetta by Indonesians. The airport's IATA code, CGK, originates from the name of the Cengkareng locality, Tangerang, Banten, although the location of this airport is located outside of the city, it is used as a gate out by the Jakartans and citizen of the surrounding areas, therefore at the main gate of the airport, there is an inscription "Jakarta Airports".[176] Soekarno–Hatta International Airport was ranked as 8th busiest airport in the world by Airports Council International in 2013.[177]Today the airport is running over capacity. After T3 Soekarno-Hatta Airport expansion has finished in May 2016, the total capacity of three terminals become 43 million passengers a year. T1 and T2 also will be revitalised, so all the three terminals finally will accommodate 67 million passengers a year.[178]
A second airport, Halim Perdanakusuma Airport (HLP) serves domestic flight of low cost airline, private and VIP/presidential flights. Other airports in the Jakarta metropolitan area include Pondok Cabe Airport and an airfield on Pulau Panjang, part of the Thousand Island archipelago (Kepulauan Seribu).
Waterway[edit]
Sea[edit]
See also: Port of Tanjung Priok
Jakarta's main seaport Tanjung Priok serves many ferry connections to different parts of Indonesia. Port of Tanjung Priok is Indonesia's busiest port, and the 21st busiest port in the world in 2013, handling over 6.59 million TEUs.[179] To boost the port capacity, two-phase "New Tanjung Priok" extension project is currently ongoing. When fully operational in 2023, it will triple existing annual capacity.
The port is also an important employer in the area, with more than 18,000 employees who provide services to more than 18,000 ships every year. The Port of Tanjung Priok has 20 terminals: general cargo, multipurpose terminal, scraps terminal, passenger terminal, dry bulk terminal, liquid bulk terminal, oil terminal, chemicals terminal and three container terminals, 76 berths, a quay length of 16,853 metres (55,292 feet), a total storage area of 661,822 square metres (7,123,790 square feet) and a storage capacity of 401,468 tonnes.[180]
In December 2011, Muara Angke Port was renovated for Rp 130 billion ($14.4 million) in a 3 hectare area. Muara Angke Port would then be used as a public port to Thousand Islands (Indonesia), while Marina Ancol Port would be used as a tourist port.[181]
River[edit]
On 6 June 2007, the city administration introduced the Waterway (officially Angkutan Sungai), a new river boat service along the Ciliwung River.[147][182] However, because of the large amount of floating garbage which kept jamming the propeller, it is no longer in service. The varying water levels during the dry and wet seasons were also a contributing factor to the close-down.

Architecture[edit]




Facade of the Museum Bank Indonesia in Kota Tua


Jakarta has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. Architectural styles reflect Malay, Javanese, Arabic, Chinese and Dutch influences.[183] The external influence gives a role in forming the architecture of the Betawi house. The houses were built of nangka wood (Artocarpus integrifolia) and comprised three rooms. The shape of the roof is reminiscent of the traditional Javanese joglo.[30]
Colonial buildings and structures in Jakarta include those that were constructed during the Dutch colonial period of Indonesia. The dominant styles of the Dutch colonial period can be divided into three periods: the Dutch Golden Age (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century – 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Dutch colonial architecture in Jakarta is apparent in buildings such as houses or villas, churches, civic buildings, and offices, mostly concentrated in the Jakarta Old Town and Central Jakarta. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and Eduard Cuypers designed some significant buildings in Jakarta. Works of Schultze includes Jakarta Art Building, the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and Ministry of Finance Building, while Cuypers designed Bank Indonesia Museum and Bank Mandiri Museum.




Wisma 46 in post-modernist architecture, currently fourth tallest building in Jakarta.


At the early 20th century, most of the buildings in the Jakarta were built in Neo Renaissance style of Europe. By the 1920s, the architectural taste have begun to shift in favour of rationalism and modernist movement, particularly there was increasing art deco architecture. The elite suburbs Menteng, developed during the 1910s, was the city's first attempt at creating an ideal and healthy housing area for the middle class. The original houses had a longitudinal organisation of space, as well as overhanging eaves, large windows and open ventilation, all practical features for a tropical climate with a hint of modern art deco.[184] It was developed by the private real estate company N.V. de Bouwploeg, established by P.A.J. Moojen.
After independence, the process of nation building in Indonesia and demolishing the memory of Dutch colonialism was as important as the symbolic building of arterials, monuments, government buildings during the Sukarno era. The National Monument in Jakarta, designed by Sukarno, is Indonesia's beacon nationalism. In the early 1960s, Jakarta with Soviet Union funding providing infrastructure development for highways and super-scale cultural monuments as well as Senayan Sports Stadium. The parliament building features a hyperbolic shaped roof reminiscent of German rationalist and Corbusian design concepts.[185] In 1996, Wisma 46 soars to height of 262 metres (860 feet) with forty eight stories and its nib shaped top celebrates technology and symbolises stereoscopy.
The urban construction booms have continued in the 21st century and are shaping skylines in Jakarta. Golden Triangle of Jakarta is one of the fastest evolving CBD in Asia-Pacific region.[186] According to CTBUH and Emporis, there are 88 skyscrapers that reaches or exceeds the height of 150 metres (490 feet) in Jakarta, which puts the city at the top 10 of world rankings.[187] It has more buildings taller than 500 feet (150 m) than any other Southeast Asia's cities as well as southern hemisphere. At present Gama Tower with 310 meters tip height is the tallest building in Jakarta.
Landmarks[edit]

Also within sister cities co-operation, Jakarta has established partnership with Rotterdam of the Netherlands, especially on integrated urban water management, including capacity building and knowledge exchange.[206] This co-operation is mainly because Jakarta and Rotterdam are dealing with similar problems; both cities lies in low-lying flat plain prone of flooding. Plus some of their areas lies below sea level, making an urban drainage system involving canals, dams and pumps is vital for both city. Jakarta seeks to learn from Rotterdam's expertise and experiences on water management.
